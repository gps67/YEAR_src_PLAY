IN OUT	CONSISTENT TERMS when IN or OUT is used

	INPUT		goods in raw materials
	OUTPUT		goods out manufactured product

	INCOME		money for goods out
	OUTGOINGS	money for raw materials

	GOODS and MONEY are opposites in a transaction exchange

		--> GOODS -->		some exchange
		<-- MONEY <--		momentarily of equal value
	
	Thats why INCOME == OUTPUT
	Thats why INPUT == OUTGOING costs
	These use opposites for IN-OUT

	being consistent with the IN-OUT terms helps
	Clarifying which is the 2 IN's it is - goods or money

	HMRC profit and loss tax, are used to money paid for good
	HMRC customs and excise, are used to warehouses and factories

		That is why VAT reports are all about INPUTS and OUTPUTS
	
 CATEGORY is everything

 	The tree of CATEGORIES has entire branches all IN all OUT

	When an XFER can be seen as two adjacent ACCOUNT_CORES

	PAYMENT from RIGHT to LEFT

		ACCT_2		ACCT1		# flip names too ?
		FUND_one	FLAT_one
		FUND_one	FLAT_two

	PAYMENT from LEFT to RIGHT 

		ACCT_1		ACCT2
		FLAT_one	FUND_one	
		FLAT_two	FUND_one

	CAT_1234 == FLAT is owing maintenance to FUND == FUND_one
	CAT_1231 == FLAT is paying for bill-so-far to FUND == FUND_one
	CAT_1231 == FLAT is paying maintenance to FUND == FUND_one

	DOUBLE ACCOUNTING is recording each line twice,
	once in the cash book
	once in the topic book
	COMBINED_DOUBLE uses CAT to convey TOPIC and then does the cash book
	IF you see CAT as AUTO_WRITING the second entry, it kind of is

	We use that, to only have one line per ACTION
	You would only have to prove that every line is correctly doubled
	We still do but it is built into the software, and tests OK
	usually

 DOUBLE ACCOUNTS

 	This is NOT double accounting
	(That is done by CAT see above)

	It is two sets of accounts,
	one on behalf of the customer
	oen on behalf of the company // the accounts primary

	OK many customers (8) so that many in the second set

	LHS_ACCT is outside the company = a customers account
	RHS_ACCT is inside the company = a company account

	choice of LHS --pays--> RHS is INCOME 
	refund of LHS <-refund- RHS is INCOME but NEGATED

		it should use the same CAT as the original overpayment
		and use a negated amount

	When a payment is made from LHS to RHS
	it is an outgoing from the LHS_CUSTOME
	it is an income into the RHS_COMPANY

	As such it looks like an XFER between 2 internal accounts
	(eg from current to savings)

	but we are doing the customers work and helping them pay their bills

PLUS amounts

	Normally, from a single PRIMARY (the company),
	a PLUS number is good for the company,
	a MINUS number is bad for the company

	This blinks when you notice that it is not yet paid.
	Lets say a subscription becomes due at the fifth day of the month

	LHS --OWES--> RHS	transfer from EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT to INTERNAL account
	LHS --OWES--> RHS	transfer from EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT to INTERNAL account

	The LHS account has become MINUS to the CUSTOME
	The customer has to pay in AMOUNT to make it ZERO

	When that happens the MONEY PAID is paid to LHS_CUST and RHS_BANK_two
