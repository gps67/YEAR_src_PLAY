	I think we should also have u16 << 1 // x2 // u17 _even
	And that gets added, with ... WORK ...
	Keep byte access to addresses stored, add to u17_mode_u16_OFFS

	OFFS is -wrt- BASE,ZERO,EA_SEGMENT_START
	OFFS is u16 // 9 of 10 // 64K of 64K // cant have 0 and N in same zero
	OFFS_0000 is often used as NULL or UNSET // OFFS used as PTR_offs_in_S
	u16_IDX_t {
	 SUBLEX SUGGESTS { u16 idx; }
	 TEMPLATE SUGGESTS { TYPE_t word_type, u32 IDX_in_a_word, // nbits == u16
	 DIAG SUGGESTS {
	 	[0] -> | LINK--> | RHS
		[i] -> | LINK--> | { OBJECT ... }
		[n] -> | -V-O-I-D- 

		 N_used = n;

		[n-1]  | LINK--> | { OBJECT ... }
		[N_ALLOCATED]  | ... // -V-O-I-D- 
	 }
	}

	All of ITEM_i can have it's own u16_SPACE SEGMENT [s] and u16_IDX_SPACE

	After CLONE_COPY, ITEM_i has a compacted ROM TABLES
	After LOCAL_EDIT, ITEM_i has active RAM TABLES n STACKS
	ITEM_i is held in a u16 space in an u24 space. 16MB is a big page 20K
	THIS_t is array_u16_of_u16 // U24_ = U16_ * 256; // click table page

	// you you have been allocated 64K DATA limits
	// you use 64K * 4 for the OFFS_ table // IN STO
	// you use 100 bytes for the header // IN STO
	// you use 200 bytes for the header // IN MEM

	// you can request multi-max-paged x_PAGE_4K PAGE_64K

	// many many condensed macro-object-heaps even--in-shared_maybe_RSN

	   item has [u8] items of u16_OFFS // can have more in second_layer
	   item can reach ...
	   item can reach [ u16 ] of SAME_SEGMENT_OBJECTS

	   item has [u16] items of u16_OFFS // can have more in second_layer
	   item has a few SEGMENTS of 64K, as many as it needs
	   item has a few SEGMENTS of 64K, but in shared SEG2+OFFS
	    nb 3 pages and a straggler // clone rewires it, RAM expands it
	    nb 0 pages and a straggler // its all the straggler

	   items fits in 2K, uses u16_OFFS compiled u8_field.EXPR
