	One evening an Cherokee elder told his son about a battle that
	goes on inside all people. He said 'my son, the battle of 2
	wolves is inside us all. One is evil. It is anger, envy, jealousy,
	sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self pitty, guilt, resentment,
	inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority and ego. The other
	is good. It is joy, peace, Love, hope, serenity, humility,
	kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion
	and faith.' The boy thought about it for a minute and then asked
	'which wolf wins?' The elder simply replied 'The one you feed'
