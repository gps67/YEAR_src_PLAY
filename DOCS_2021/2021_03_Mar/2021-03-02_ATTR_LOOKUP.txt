 Python lacks an ATTR_LOOKUP_CACHE
 It repeatedly does a STRING lookup in extn_type
 So lookup ATTR_NAME in CLASS_DRY to get (new) ATTR_LOOKUP_CACHE
 Then apply that as a getter to the instance

 well known GET/SET/CALL (callable)
  += YES
  += OFFS in struct
  += rettype
  += GETTER( self ) (^var)
  += SETTER( self ) (val)
  += GETTER( self ) (callable) += EA_fixed += closure_obj

 The builtin ATTR list is quite fixed
 The commonly added ATTR's
 The occasionally added ATTR's
 The speculatively no-such-attr # also cache-able
