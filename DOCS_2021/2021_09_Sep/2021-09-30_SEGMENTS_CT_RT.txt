	CONST

		....
	
	CT KNOWN
	RT declare CONSTS as VARS, set VAL, optionally set PAGE READONLY

		lift_RO_to_RW

			RT initialised, then converted BACK to RO

			sum_of_all_user keeps it RW whilst init
			refcount pushes it back to RO
			and-or-alarm when recount not zero after SYNC

	SYNC

		PREV == SYNC_START

		  lots of data writes

		  SYNC REQUEST

		  more writes
		  all threads return
		  fflush // itself flushes

		  SYNC DONE

		NEXT == SYNC_END
	
	MMAP

		COW_SAYS_IT_HAS_FORKED_A_PAGE 

		 MMAP says PAGE write
		 allocate additional - different page
		 do nothing - it is already allocated,
		 but has no WRITE BACK ADDR

		 MMAP says PAGE write
		 if PAGE already registed, just playing hide + seek, do so, ret
		 create a new PAGE in QUEUE to DISK
		 write PAGE to TRACK += QUEUE += PAGE

		At end of SYNC (all data received, all pages known)
		rearrange TRACK into order, merge adjacent pages

			remap WHERE_STORED to WHERE_INSTALLED
