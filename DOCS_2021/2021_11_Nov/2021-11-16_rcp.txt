	rsync fails half way

		sort of spoils the point of using rsync (local)
		not much luck with kill + restart (or worse?)

		that was with WiFi
		eth0 gigabyte ran OK with plain mc / cp

		generally fails were "io error"
		previous problems were ONLY on close of file
		which left the mtime uid perms unset
	
	Still need for scp tcp ... with lzo on queue

		when idle, pre-compress AOT upto DEPTH
		when moving, top-up queue,
		when queue collapses, jump over queued ?
