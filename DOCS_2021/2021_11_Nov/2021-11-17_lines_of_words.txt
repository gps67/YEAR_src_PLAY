		problem is sharing strings between TCL PY STR0 str1 buffer1

	py_tcl_tk
	SPIN_py called from Tcl
	 write in CXX / Py style in py api
	 call from Tcl 
	 keep Tcl_Obj => py_object

	 	PTR2 == py_obj
		VAL1 == u16_u8_u8

		STR0 == idx || plausible value

	Because py_obj is more flexible, variable number of fields, etc
	write Module into py_object as CXX base
	(but stuck with no VTBL, so plain C with some classes)

		py -IS- the obj_struct
		tcl -AS- the PTR2 
		both with ref Counts, different malloc
		separated by API 
	
	Tempting - Tcl STR0

		but avoiding for now
		do want NULL bytes 
		do want bind to work

		solve CSET in libs_apps.base.buffer1 or .blk1 bytes
	
	STR0 Py Tcl buffer1 
	ASCII 8859 utf8 

		TCL
