chrome debugger

	the debugger itself runs some functions on UDEF functions
	on USER code data DIC on ...

	ie when in debugger mode, single stepping alien code
	the code is actually run, at full speed, by the debugger,
	but not in debug single step mode

	so putting a few GETTERS on some key HTML elements (or other)
	shows how debugger works, might help debugging, might help hackers

	GETTER	my_div.id
