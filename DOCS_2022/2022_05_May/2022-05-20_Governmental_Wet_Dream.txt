Spelling matters, but so does propaganda, othering, and ridiculing others into compliance, in support of some global narrative. Not even their own.

Take this majority of this thread, and hold it up to the light, eg ask if it looks like they are convinced of:

100% safe
100% effective
Lasts forever

How many people here prefer that to be 100% true? Have they invested their identity into that belief, and any thing else is a danger to their inner core, Some claim to have read, but maybe with their eyes closed.

Maybe that seems harmless, it just encourages more care, more people to get their basic shots, and only a few will be allergic, or the universal clotting will be mild for most.

But maybe the imposition of lockdowns has been a governmental wet dream, and it seems to be sponsored by the masses, doing it to themselves.

With memes guiding the way.
