	Your tasks are many
	You are expected to update this document, and the others
	That will be for yourself, for the next person, for me, etc
	If you are doing home schooling, that will need documenting too.
	If this is not your thing, do it well and move on

	ESP32 is a mini computer with Wifi and Bluetooth and IO
	ESP32 comes in a range of built-in accessories, on the big chip
	ESP32 is one choice, ARM32 ARM64, MCU, Arduino, RaspberryPi ... no wifi
	ESP32 might be a weather station box in the garden, solar battery?

	LAPTOP you need one to edit, compile the code, load onto the ESP32, etc

	NOT YET - esp-idf - IoT Development Framework
	NOT YET - XXX - FreeRTOS
	NOT YET - XXX - mupy - do it in py not C++

	Arduino - development environment

	Arduino = older naffer chip

GLOSSARY WHAT IS ...

	CPU = brain of a machine
	MCU = microcontroller unit = CPU + IO + ROM
	ROM = flash readonly memory
	RAM = Random Access memory fast read write drop on power off
	IOT = internet of things
	IO = in / out
	IDE = interactive development environment
	GPIO = General Purpose IO
	IO += touch sensitive capacitive pin

	PWM = fractions out of ON/OFF
	A2D = amalog to digital (microphone to wav to mp3)
	D2A = digital to analog

	I2S = 
	I2C
