I personally like the tea dances at the canoe club best. The venue is overlooking the Thames. Mainly traditional music.
 
The Saturday evening one in Woodley has an excellent floor, but has been quiet lately. Mainly traditional music.
 
Tango risqu√© includes other music.

Papa Caliente is the best milonga in Reading: Very good venue, excellent DJ, perfect organisation, good dancers come from far. Mainly nuevo with some traditional music. Unfortunately only every second month.
