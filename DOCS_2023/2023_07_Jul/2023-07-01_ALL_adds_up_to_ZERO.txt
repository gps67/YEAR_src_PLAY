 CONSERVATION of ENERGY - is a must

 	ENERGY can switch
	from photon to
	kinetic electron
	kinetic molecule
	dissipate 
	maybe_on_to_photon


 BALANCE

	Sunlight (energy) lands on the Earth.
	Eclipes would be something in its shadow :-)

	The same amount of energy that is received, 
	must be matches and emitted, out to space.

	If not, the imbalance causes us to get warmed (or colder).
	We notice this on an annual cycle,
	when it continues to get colder after the shortest day,
	and get warmed after the longest day, for many weeks.
	Basically the ocean surfaces buffer things a lot,
	slowing down the changes, averaging them out a bit.

	Cloud tops reflecting light counts as emitting,
	I dont know how much of that is as IR.

	Light from the Sun is more UV than IR,
	so it goes through CO2 without noticing.

	Light from the Earth is more IR,
	and it resonates with the CO2 bond lengths,
	so that an IR photon is absorbed and all the energy
	is shuffled around, becoming kinetic energy,
	warming up, and emitting more IR.

	Half upwards, half downwards, (of that new IR),
	so it takes a hotter Earth to get the same amount of
	energy out to space.

	In summer you see cities with absurd temperatures.
	Then just in time it rains a bit. Enough to wash the
	energy down to the sea, and let us persevere.

	The warmer surface, evaporates more.

	Warmer air holds more moisture. 7% for 1'C

	Dry soil, loses it's moisture,
	so it is droughts here, and floods there.
	Hopefully not one then the other.

 CONSERAVTION of ENERGY

	In any and all actions, there must be a CONSERAVTION of ENERGY,
	that is the law.
	
	Literally, it's something they noticed, that seems to
	always be true wherever they looked, so they declared it a law,
	how STEM patriachal!!.

	More so, to keep that true at the big band, they made stuff up.
	They have this super-symmmetry of negative matter and negative
	energy. It all adds up to zero. The whole universe, everything.
	Nothing !! All of it!!

	Of course that might not be the case,
	but so far every test confirms it.

	There is an exactly matching conservation of MASS, and point_count
	(every particle is a mux of information points). No particle
	was every created nor deleted.

	Even the phenomonon of "lost mass" never actually loses
	an entire particle, the weight of 1.0 gets squeesed down to 0.9.
	Thats waht happens when neutrons (and protons) get squashed
	into a nucleaus, or POP, get release to escape.

	During the squish, the mass is fractionally squished out to another
	dimention (eg inside). That lost mass is exchanged as energy
	released, hot kinetic energy. This is a rare radioactive reaction
	(so all the time then). The sun is converting Hydrogen to Helium
	all the time.

	Atomic weight
	H 1.00784
	He 4.002602o

	He / 4 == 1.0006505

	1.0006505 / 
	1.00784 
	=
	0.9928664272106684 // factor 0.7% loss

	1.00784 /
	1.0006505  
	=
	1.007184826270511 0.7% loss / gain
