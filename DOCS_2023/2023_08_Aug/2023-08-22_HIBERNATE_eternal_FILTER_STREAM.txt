SLOW but not stupid

	QEMU interprets ASM32 or ARM64 or RISC_V

		treat as WASM
		use LOHI anyway
		use LOHI ARM does

		permit GET ASM at CT_COMPILE // link asif freash // ROM //

		PERMIT GEN ASM for REGEXP (or local YACC)
		PERMIT GEN ASM from GCC from CXX via CXX_to_CPP // either
		_CPP C_PRE_PROCESSOR or C_PLUS_PLUS
		need VBOX with libc GCC BINUTILS SHELL MAKEFILES_for_BUILTIN

LEVELS of CONTAINED

	VLAN is not connected to WLAN

		TENT is caching own local DB
		DB RELAY BATCH after done !!! autonomy


	VLAN is SITE_WIDE

		VPN reaches POOL ON_SITE_VLAN
		VPN can be patchy, option for USB TAPE relay
		BATCH REPLAY UPDATE DB_CACHE
		every week
		every hour
		every 5 seconds or so
		every unexplained outage of 10 minutes
		server consolidates all update then redistrubites
		APPL does own RELAY system // UPDATE_BROADCAST_FILTERED
