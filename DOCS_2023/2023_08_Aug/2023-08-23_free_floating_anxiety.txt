	The anxiety is climate change generally but without any specifics

	The free floating is vague non-specifics

	MASS Formation Hypnosis also uses NON_SPECIFIC_ANXIETY
	MASS Formation Hypnosis also uses SPECIFIC_POINT_OF_FOCUS 
	but it is a detail not a question
	the Nuebulous FOG is absorbed as self-floatation aclimated self
	eg in a floatation tank you merge with surroundings
	eg in clothes, they are you

	The original issue: 

		human extinction
		show me the best evidence you have
		(stated as "there is none")
		(evidence provided: picture of death valley desert)

			that is metaphor of dust bowl tricky
			that is not extinction
			that is vague timeless destination_distant

	The original issue: expands to adjacent obviously related things

		the moment of human extinction
		how would that pan out
		how would that come about
		what would happen when
		at what temperature does stuff happen
		where is there a document on this
		or even the commonly accepted outline
			- there isn't one -
		and also the proofs of the components
		as best we get
			- you are not supposed to look for this -
	
	I noticed

		the thread ignored the "where is evidence of extinction ?"
		the thread distracted to "ahh its just a heatwave"
			or something
			no worries about the extinction aspect
			no worries about the complete lack evidence
			usual drift into CC generally
			usual drift into non-specific-nebulous-enemy
	
	I grumbled and asked a question

		I grumble too much, inner hector

		specific question // not allowed in VAGUE land 

		try-to-imagine-the-situation-when question

			to say what happened
			what straw broke the camels back

			it wasn't rising sea levels - just move

			was it the relatively small local floods storms

			was it a continent size disaster

			would we survive ONE continents crop fail ?

			what if it happen 3 times in 1 decade
			or in 3 continents in same year
