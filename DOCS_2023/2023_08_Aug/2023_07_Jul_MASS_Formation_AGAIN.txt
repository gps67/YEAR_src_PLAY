Belgium


(1) no critical distance from their beliefs
(2) willing to sacrifice everything
    that used to be important to them
(3) intolerent of dissonant voices


People go along

conditions

atomisation,
 lonely isolated disconnected,
 from people and nature,

free floating anxiety

20% fanatically in the grip of idelogy, narrative
start to form a mass,
led by leaders, grabs control of state aparatus
private police, snitch on everyone,

40% lack of meaning - naff jobs

once disconnected, no meaning, specific effects
free floating aaxniety, frustration and aggression,
without clear cause,

(STEP-1)
narrative: gives object of blame
indicates object of anxiety
provides stategy to deal with aforementioned
eg lockdown to deal with virus
eg witch-hunts to deal with witches
eg crusades to liberate Jerusalem

that channels the free-floating anxiety towards the object of anxiety
participate, even if absurd, brings back control,

(STEP-2)
feel connected as part of heroic battle, solidarity

mass connecting to IDEA not eachother to collective

	loss of empathy,
	its the movement not the individual

	switch out empathy for witch-hunts
	mental surrender to ... policy ...

	new group edges, forget old groups,
	clever groups align to take advantage of that,
	eg free speech is a right wing negative

Small group, dont go along, try to wake up masses, fails,
but if they continue, in a quiet way, may prevent end stage
but they risk their own minor mass formation !!

12 months after stopping cruelty starts
end stage is cruel, against people who dont go along
as if it was their ethical duty to cut them down
[19] 
voice of a leader crystalises
