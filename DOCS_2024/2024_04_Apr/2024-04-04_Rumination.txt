	Rumination is 
	(1) mulling over some depression
	(2) the opposite

	Opposite is the cure
	ignore all rumours
	enact upon rumours // but require PERMIT the ACTION
	ie it isn't really a rumour, its a fact, an ACTION

	Sometimes opening up about an issue,
	adds sunlight to clear the way

	Sometimes repeating is to focus-amplify beyond this dimention

	repeating is going to happen a lot near the issue
	repeating is going to systematically find stuff
	repeating is going to brainwash yourself into a predicted destiny

		show willingness to talk about the issue // took a while
		show willingness to talk about the issue // too keen to decl
		show willingness to talk about the issue // ruminating

	instead do ACTION recommended by FILTER += get_out_the_house
	FILTER += new_habit future_new_habit future_old_habbit // ANTI is DOTE
	DOTE += "falls_into_bad_habits -from-> future_old_habit"
	PARSE += "GAP_allow_NONE" // empty_GAP // but with inline PSG DONE

	ACTION get_out_more
	ACTION ongoing_new_habit // _ongoing means FILTER
	ACTION do_a_task // as a repeating ongoing FILTER
	ACTION APPROACH // plugs into API onto generic FILTER on STREAM
	STREAM of OPPORTUNITIES to convert with ACTION
	FILTER accumulate all TASK_LIST that float through STREAM 
	STREAM += OPERATOR_INPUT += BENCH_CHATTER


	GAP MATCH "{ a3_GAP STAR }" // a3_GAP += " SP TAB CR LF FF CTRL ESC "
	a3_GAP_poss += " /* %s */ "
