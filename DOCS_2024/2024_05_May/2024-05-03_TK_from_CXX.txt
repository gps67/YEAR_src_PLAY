	CALL Tk from CXX

	switch to tcl main event loop
	still uses old select_says_
	as even that was not true

	Manage structures of Tk widgets though CXX behaviours

		my setup for my profile
		edit CXX_INIT/init_Tk_and_local_cache

		LOCAL CACHE -> CACHE -> WLAN -> REMOTE

			WLAN does tls using KEYS
			WLAN does
				WLAN_PKT_IN
				WLAN_API_ENQ_ACK
				     API_QnA

		REMOTE CACHE bunches up requests to REMOTE 

			CPU will quickly make all requests
			CACHE will BATCH_SENT the list and track
			CACHE will PROVIDE cached copy of REMOTE

				option to hold this back until ACK
				possibility that ALL fields are answered
				possibility that MANY fields are unchanged
				possible that ALL fields now available
				at latest version
				with locks CLOCKS tick_tock sync_edge_api

					SYNC EDGE _api

		REMOTE behind safety wall is USER FILE RORW DRIVE 

			ACTION DRIVE something
			ACTION machine in motion
			ACTION extra admin filter provides old_val_new_val

				obtaining old_val 
				comes from a hint list provided by remote
				fetch all of this list // hint newval NEAR

		OBJ $obj_id GET FIELD 
		OBJ $obj_id GET FIELD AVAR_FIELD // silent MK_VAR infer mention

			creates FIELD as a local variable in scope
			fetches its value from $obj_id // obj_id_xFFFF
			optionally binds write back pathway to sync_edge

				tick_clock pernding sync_edge
				tick_clock same one adding details
				tick_clock the only clock is ERA_STEP_SYNC_EDGE

		PSG CIDENT99 PUNCT GAP TEXT SCRIPT PDF LIBR

			PSG " CIDENT_obj_name . CIDENT_fieldname "
			PSG " CIDENT_obj_name " as LHS upto HERE CSR

		CSR HERE - inherits LHS but TOKENISED AVAR

			similar tricks to LOCAL - REMOTE
			caller gets here with LHS
			script uses NAME of LHS in this case
			script uses PHRASE of LHS in that case
			PSG uses . as LHS = "OBJ." // writing PUNCH shows CSR
			PSG uses " " as LEX_EDGE_after_CIDENT // POSSIBLE STOP
			PSG uses " " crushable_gap, for comma, Q2, etc
