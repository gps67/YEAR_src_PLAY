	One bunch of rules say, that all onlookers must attempt to do
	everything sensible to stop a disaster. Another bunch of rules,
	say it isn't starvation, not really. No event until people
	actually die. Where is the pre-meditation in this?

	A sequence of mishaps
	that only lead one way,
	on a prepared platform,
	of siege,
	a long term calorie controlled decade long,
	pre-siege,
	of questioning the Red Cross,
	of accusing UNRWA of terrorism,
	of denying the sheer numbers of children casualties,
	of phoning people to tell them that their house is about to
	be bombed,
	of forcing mass migrations to places that are safe,
	except they suddenly aren't,
	of mass graves of hospital staff,
	of making kitchen NGO's run away in fear of their staff's lives.

+	of using their own Aunties into this shielding labelled as ANTI_
+	eg FAKE STORY when confronted cries WOLF # FLIP BLAME VICTIM CLAIM

	There are mishaps, and there is design.

	We are looking at a massive crime, and as onlookers, we should
	not be cheering them on, we should not be sending them munitions
	and repairs. If they really dont believe in things like embassies,
	then they dont need them here,	An office would be enough.

	Failing to send a message, is sending a message of support,
	is complicity, in this massive crime. (Google the numbers)
