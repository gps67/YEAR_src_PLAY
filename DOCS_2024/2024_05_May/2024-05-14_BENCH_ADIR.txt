	BENCH creates TEMP_ANON_FILES with real names in VFS

		FILES NAMES unique in VFS ARENA // _in_MINI_MACHINE
		FIELD names unique in MINI_MACHINE // or in SCOPE //
		FILENAME FILTER "{ ASIF LHS RHS }"
	
	APP connects MOBILE and is ASIF VFS OBJ_JS_over_NET_via_CACHE

		BENCH creates DIR for OBJ 

		SESS/BENCH/LOCN/OBJ/OBJ_FF

			BENCH_LOCN = BENCH/LOCN_/_%04X/_FFFF

			_FFFF means "_FFFF" 
			_FFFF means "_%04X" 
			_FFFF means   BOTH 
	
	ADIR = BENCH_LOCN

		ALIAS switches to GEN AVAR as "AVAR" 
		ALIAS switches to GEN AVAR as "AVAR_%X" // _IDX as _FFF _F _FF
		ALIAS switches to GEN AVAR as "AVAR_%04X" // _FFFF
		PICK VIEW and GEN redraws DIAG with that new OPTION

		VFS/BENCH/LOCN_/_%X 	// API uses VFS TEMPLATE PICK OPTIONS
		VFS/BENCH/BENCH_LOCN_ARRAY/_%X 	// 
		VFS/BENCH/BENCH_LOCN_ARRAY/%s_%X // 

		GEN uses PICK to build above 
		CT_RT uses GEN to create CACHE that need compiling
		CT_RT calls compiler 
		CT_RT provides JIT compiler 
		CT_RT provides SCRIPT interp
		CT_RT provides API ARGV and MODULE stuff
		CT_RT uses "safe" scripts // DEFAULT GEN //
	
	LOCN = ADIR
	ADIR = LOCN

		both phrases are added to MATCH DECODE STEP // STEPS_AVAIL
