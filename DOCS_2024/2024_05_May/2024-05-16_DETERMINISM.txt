	QUANTUM claims CHAOS as

		WHEN and IF something happens

			consequences are HEAT so usual entropy
			once done entropy locks it into place
			there was no other mandela effect

			consequences are OTHER - add yours here

				LIST
				HERE
				ITEM

		NOISE LEVEL of CHAOS

			eg at our human level (440Hz = mid range)
			pink noise hiss (pick a flavour) has db

				signal_to_noise ratio
				3%
				0.03%

			flocking peaks

				occasional peak of 15% 
				rare but quite a few peaks at 6%

			so there is a much larger SIGNAL threshold

				ie a NERVE SIGNAL PULSE 
				is massively in excess of 3% noise

		CHAOS NOISE says truly random is for DREAM_SWEEP
		CHAOS NOISE says mildly_random is unavoidable (expensive to avoid)

		CHAOS NOISE says we all have mad moments, which we inexplicably keep
		CHAOS NOISE says DREAM ran lots of random simulations and KEPT these

		Above QUANTUM CHAOS is scattered random chaos
		technically deterministic, but way beyond the 3 body problem
		Basic perturbations that bounce around, merge, split, intensify, cancel,
	
	CHAOS claims determinism

		Getting into your career, has done you well, and you chose it.
		But even that choice was the deterministic falling in love with choice.

		Choice was a fleeting glimpse out the window, the thought of a memory,
		which we know can be triggered by obscure associations.

		Thinking more about choice, following it up, led to more about it.
		Then choice was a good choice.

ALSO
	10e20
		how many planks in an atom
		how many atoms in a mol of atoms
		how many plank_times in a PICO second
		show plot of what at time 
		how many G in T

 DETERMINISTIC NOISE
 cant be distinguished from
 CHAOTIC NOISE

 both are similar at our 10e20 %level and scatter patterns
