	The government says it wants to incentivise HOME solar

	One way to do that, would be to pay the price difference
	between WHOLESALE and RETAIL

		HOME SOLAR sells power at WHOLESALE rate (minus costs)
		GRID buts power at WHOLESALE rate (minus costs)
		GRID sells power at WHOLESALE rate (plus costs)
		HOME CONSUMER buys at RETAIL rate

		HOME CONSUMER obviously gets own electricity for "FREE"
		SOME MAD LAWS already hint at future claiming that
		EG farms paying for own rainwater that they collect
		It does make sense to do so, but it is absurd

		MY suggested incentive, is to pay the HOME CONSUMER

		GRID buys power at WHOLESALE rate (minus costs)
		PLUS adds SUBSIDY, from WHOLESALE_to_RETAIL
		HOME SOLAR sells power at RETAIL rate (YEYA!)
	
		The GRID has to do the paperwork, the GOVT audits it,
		and pays the HOMW SOLAR directly via the GRID_COMPANY
		but in aggregate form, computed to be worth ... should be ...
		ZERO plays catchup, on a monthly basis, no accumulated SLIP
	
	BUT the GOVT cleverly realised a way to pretend to do that was:

		GRID buys power at WHOLESALE rate (wants to ... anyway)
		GRID pays out the subsidy, doesnt get it back anywhere
		GRID buys power at RETAIL rate (by lay)


		So of course they don't

		The GRID company finds endless excuses to not buy HOME_SOLAR
		EG we have the wrong wires to collect, only distribute
		EG there are phasing issues going in the opposite direction
		EG it is a STEP down not a STEP up, transformer

		So there is no money to upgrade the GRID,
		So no collect (or a lot less, and not exponential)


	Another way is for GOVT to charge land use fees.

		Agriculture gets low land tax rates

		Industry gets high land tax rates

		Solar farms raising 100 Million,
		is an extra 100M before anyone buys one

		Even billionaire companies have problems with rent
