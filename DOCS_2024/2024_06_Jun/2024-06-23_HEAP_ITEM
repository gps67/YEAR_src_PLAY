	u16_HEAP_ITEM {
	 u4_HEAP
	 u12_ITEM
	}

	OPCODE can cantain u4_bitfields
	simply by claiming a clutch of 16 SLOTS // adjacent
	This is M_N with M found at where CLUTCH finds ZERO

	I am imposing a philosophy of i12 and u12
	I am imposing a philosophy of u12 not i12
	I am imposing you use M_N held in i16_or_wider
	To provide MINUS there are RULES and M_N obeys them

	This is a generic code (BASE+OFFS) (ARRAY[idx])
