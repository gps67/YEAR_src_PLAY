	We extend an i32 to i33
	We extend an i64 to i64
	We require an extra BIT OPT_BIT MEGA_MINUS 

	We need to track every single operation
	and track SIGN of RET_VAL and the BORROW_of_RETVAL

		CARRY_of_RETVAL means

			exceeded HALF
			of one bit less
			of ARITH UNS_and_INT // big mess

		CARRY_of_RETVAL avoided means

			still there - not completely disappeared
			now_as_BORROW_ZERO_CARRY_OVERFLOW_FLAGS
			quarter zone crossing is CPU_DETECTED

			crossing QUARTER zone can be avoided
			by SHIFT LEFT then SIGNED SHIFT RIGHT
			by SHIFT LEFT then UNSIGNED SHIFT RIGHT

			crossing quarters can also be avaoided
			by using a FULL page of u12_IDX items
			and looking at NULL as CACHE_SAYS_NEW_USE

				FIRST_USE_EVER
				FIRST_USE_SINCE
				FIRST_USE_CAUSING_ANY_MODIFIED_FLAG
				 

			MMAP has attrs per page,
			not actually in PAGE not IDX but in HEAP_MGMT



			exceeded HALF
			of one bit less
			of ARITH UNS_and_INT // big mess
