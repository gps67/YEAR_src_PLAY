	mkdir_DOES("DOES")

		HOME/YEAR/DOES\

			DOES can be a SYNB_LINK from FILTER SELF
	
	WE ask DIARY_SESS "{ mkdir DOES }"

		As a DIARY it does its expected FILTER ACTION

			mkdir YEAR-MM-DD 
			{ YEAR-MM-DD HH-MM-SS } {
				YEAR-MM-DD
				HH-MM-SS
			}

		As an API it provides SAFE_SCRIPT VAR_POOLS API

			DIAG {
			...
			}

		each DIR gets DIARY_PRESENCE in SESS
		each DIARY gets DIARY_PRESENCE in SESS

		FILTER is SCRIPT going through FILTER
		FILTER provide VARS in VAR_LIST or VAR_POOL_ _idx

	TASK MKDIR DOES //
	//	create a TASK as YEAR_MM_DD_%s
	//	LEXER looks for its own rules { %s %s %s }
	//	OBJ_ARGV as %X // %s == STR0 // %s == _FFFF // has own fmt //
	//	UNDERSTAND _FFFF // from MODULE.exports.USAGE_VAR_NAME _IDX
	//	LEXER rule[IDX] = subst { %s %s %s } with { %X %X %X }
	//	ie %X requires an INT VALUE
	//	ie %X invokes a MACRO FMT %04X %04lX // eg 64K HEAP 


	The SAMPLE as CODE above is not enough
	The SAMPLE as CODE below is plenty

	%X  ->  %04X // is that 0 necessary - should be
	"_FFFF" -> "_%04X" // CT_RT can move _ around MATCH_PLUS
	"%s_FFFF" {
		HEAP = PARAMETER("HEAP") .GET_VAR_as_VALUE
		IDX idx = ITEM_LIST_COUNTER_N ++; // MATCH with rename N
	}

	HEAP_t HEAP = PARAMETER("HEAP") // look in SESS near ITEM THIS
	IDX idx = ALLOC_idx(HEAP) // GEN STYLE
	IDX idx = HEAP.ALLOC_idx() // GEN STYLE

	GEN repeats template for i8 i16 i32 i64

		if you want u8 you will have to go i16 
		at 128 we are out of range u7 i8 
		so step up to i16
		special case for exact_FULL_ZERO_MEANS_FULL_CARRY_1

			a complete PAGE gets added to QUEUE
			need to wait for LIST of LOCKS and TASKS to COMPLETE

	MINUS_ZERO_PLUS
	ALLOC_IDX
	ALLOC_OFFS

	short codes are when IDX fits inside a BYTE using M_N
	there is a nineth bit, in the CODE_POINT (each of them)

		IDX idx = ALLOC_idx(ARGS)

	Inline is happy with 4 args which become named exprs,
	with no actual call made.

	Inline is happy when call is made

	CXX_ARGS_API means we might as well ALWAYS pass 4 PARAMETERS

		use each as a NEAREST COPY of VALUE
		use as they will spontaneously disappear at end
		CT_RT may have prepared a CTOR_CALL_LIST // some_EMPTY

		ARGV = CMD_ZERO ONE TWO TAIL

	MY_API wants RET_VAL in REGISTER - so must be preserved

		ENQ_ACK 	ITEM  ->  WRAP_ITEM
		ENQ_ACK 	ITEM  ->  FILTERED_ITEM
		ENQ_ACK 	ENQ  ->  ACK

	So RET_VAL might be adjusted, or completely different, or SAME

		SAME means nothing, except when it does
		SAME means stop attempting to compile EXPR it is SELF
		SAME means nothing EXTRA, again, ever, measured, HERE
