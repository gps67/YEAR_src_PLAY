	DIALECT_xFFFF
	DIALECT_%s CIDENT_STR0 ## BOUND TOKEN to STR0 ASIF .name


	didn't believe it,
	but accepted it.

	
	DIALECT %s
	CIDENT %s
		
		SELF.BASE_CLASS += { HERE DECL PSG LEX }

			LEX is so localised
			the unconstrained grammar
			must comply with { STEP u8_u8_OPCODE A_R_G_V_PLUS } {}
	
	INDENT_SYSTEM is py3 with gps
	INDENT_SYSTEM is CXX with gps
	INDENT_SYSTEM is X11 with gps
	INDENT_SYSTEM is ARGB_32 with gps // transparent u32 RGB_u24 // RGBA
	INDENT_SYSTEM is WIN32 with gps

	ARGB 
	RGBA u32_RGBA u24_RGB u8_A


	is everything a questions ?

	what else would it be ?


	so meh, entropy plus practise, from scratch, again

		EG THIS is consious NOW or NEAR with '%s' Q1_TAIL

		Q1_TAIL = TAIL_Q1("%s", Q1_argv_one // _1 // _two = _2

			sort of hope Q1 rules already applied
			either require PREPARE PRELOAD PRE_FILTERED STR0
			either require RUNTIME PRELOAD PRE_FILTERED STR0
