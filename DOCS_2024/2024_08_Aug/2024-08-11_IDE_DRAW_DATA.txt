	X11 and WIN32 as WAX

		or currently unported
		as lots of work
	
	X11 as WAX 
	W32 as WAX 

	WAX as WAX
	WAX as X11
		approach from familiar DIALECT

		for each WAX - port to W32
	
	DRAW P0P2
	DRAW TAPE of MEMORY

		8 letter word over block_edge 
		PARSE to EOLN and beyond
	
		8K stream of indented_block_of_text
		all on one line

		8K stream of ARGV and WRAP ARGV

		P0P2 as XPOS_N_byte

			u3_nbyte
			u3_x4_nbyte // _32 _BYTES
			u3_x8_nbyte // _64 _BYTES

				1 WORD
				8 BYTES
				64 BITS

				2 WORDS
				16 BYTES
				128 BITS

				4 WORDS
				32 BYTES
				256 BITS

				8 WORDS
				64 BYTES
				512 BITS

				16 WORDS

	DRAW HEAP 

		HEAP in a FILE
		HEAP in a STREAM
		EDIT as nbytes with EDIT_OPCODE

			new AVAR { NAME SPEC ADDR }
	
	NOT STR0

		STR0 is the simplest STR as it runs upto NUL byte

		UTF8 can have ERROR_EOF_WITHIN_UTF9_glyph_bytes

			get more data, restart from first FAIL 

		UTF8 is then as simple as STR0 ASCII // but CSET unknown //

		SIMULATING STR0 with P0P2

			enables TEXT to be MMAP of FILE in HEAP
			enables STR0 to be within that TEXT
			just with SP instead of NUL
			or PUNCT or SOMETHING PSG uses
