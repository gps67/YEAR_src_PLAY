It is very difficult, to deal with heritage, that conflicts with personal sensibilities. South-Mid-North americans, have a lot of pride in how they were, when completely oppressed. Headscarves, dances, ceremonies, how things were when they held on to what they could.

Cultures in Africa, did a lot of Soli, of the good and the tough parts of Soli, the life lessons, and the cutting, whether it was caused by the Abrahamic influences, or pre-dates that, it almost certainly had opponents, and supporters. I guess the best we can do, is document, annotate, distinguish and clarify, as much as our abilities can. 

I would be interested in a project around our use of Solo's alternative to Soli. I try not to pretend tech actions, as they usually end up as evaporated promises, but what I do get working, could be applied to that material, yes please.
