		%s_%04X 
		%s_%04X lhs rhs
		%s_%04X NAME i12_IDX

		my %X defaults to 16 bit because that is a lot

		in SCRIPT match("%s_FFFF") 

	API_GUI
	API_UI
	API_UI_GUI_SIGNALS

	This is why there are two forms

	GUI - lexicon_one
	 UI - lexicon_two

	 	_one and _two and _here
		// SYSTEM does not use LEFT_DUNDER
		// ie it leaves it intentionally as UDEF
		// so you can use _something and not get conflicted (_yet_)

		GUI LEXICON pixel_lines border_width glyph 2D rotated paper

		GUI += _2D // LEFT_DUNDER means 3 is a2 and not a1 a1_a2_star
		GUI += 

i32
u32

	Looking at strong_type_matching particularly SIGNED_BITFIELDS

		parameters

			SIGNED_BITFIELD_t // ie it is a DECL_SIGNED_BITFIELD

				UNSIGNED_BITFIELD from filled _one

				CAST (u32)i32_IDENT

				BITFIELD i32_IDENT {
					PARSE_EVERYTHING %s_%s  i32  IDENT 
				}

rename_DIR
reword_LINK_to_DIR
accept_OLD but require CONFIRM if it ovverrides any other RULE eg ALIAS_if


	Place a token in the DIR
	Place a token about the DIR in a nearby DB access and EXPR

	DB vfs_one TABLE ##
