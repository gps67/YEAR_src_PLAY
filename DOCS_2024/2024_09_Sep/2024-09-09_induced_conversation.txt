	Induced conversation is a manipulative tactic used by narcissists
	to get someone to engage with them, especially when they've
	been trying to break off contact or "hoover" someone back into
	a relationship.

	Here are some ways narcissists use induced conversation:

	Find a way to get you to talk: Narcissists will try to get you
	to talk to them about anything, even neutral topics or money.

	Get you to respond: Narcissists want you to respond, defend
	yourself, or argue so they can keep control of the relationship.

	Connect with your vulnerability: Narcissists will use a strategy
	that connects with your vulnerability.

	Some other signs of a narcissistic communicator include:

	Hoarding conversation time

	Controlling the conversation topic

	Frequently interrupting

	Unempathetic listening

	Excessive self-praise and aggrandizement

	False superiority complex

	Know-it-all attitude and unsolicited advice

	Manipulation or using others as an extension of themselves

	To avoid induced conversation, you can try refusing to interact
	with the narcissist. You can also use the "observe don't absorb"
	technique to avoid being emotionally triggered and activated
