			stretch lock may require other things

			eg pre-load {LIST_of_FILES}

			ie THREAD obtains the lock
			because the PRE_RUN_SWEEP said it was a good idea
			PRE_RUN_SWEEP looked at PARSED SCRIPTS
			found all MENTIONS
			found all VAR_NAMES
			found all LOCKS in planning list

			then no need to most locks
