		converts BITMAP to STROKED

		Potrace(TM) is a tool for tracing a bitmap,

			which means, transforming a bitmap into a smooth,
			scalable image.

			The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP format),

				PBM i1_MONO P4 ${width} ${height} // 
				// i1 1==black 0==white
				// BYTE_BITS in VIEW_BITS _L2R //
				// PBM P1 // two BYTE per BIT 0 SP 1 SP
				PGM u4_grey
				PPM P6 RGB_u16 // u16_or_any //
				BMP

			and the output is one of
			several vector file formats.

			SVG
			PDF
			EPS
			PostScript
			DXF
			GeoJSON
			PGM (for easy antialiasing of pixel-based images),
			Gimppath, and
			XFig.
			Additional backends might be added in the future.

			A typical use is
			to create SVG or PDF files from scanned data,
			such as company or university logos, handwritten
			notes, etc. The resulting image is not "jaggy"
			like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered
			at any resolution.

			Potrace can currently produce the following output
			formats: SVG, PDF, EPS, PostScript, DXF, GeoJSON,
			PGM (for easy antialiasing of pixel-based images),
			Gimppath, and XFig. Additional backends might
			be added in the future.
