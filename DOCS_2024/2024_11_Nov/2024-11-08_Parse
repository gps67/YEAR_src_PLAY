 We have evolved along pathways, 
 where suspension of disbelief happens every month - gathering
 where suspension of disbelief happens every day - fabric of our day to day

 It may be that we are pre-programmed to be programmed,
 to act out these stories, as the pages turn

 Earliest structures: Radiocarbon dating indicates that the earliest structures at GÃ¶bekli Tepe were built between 9,500 and 9,000 BCE

or 500 years later
or 250 years later midpoint
so 11,774 years ago 

 13,000 years ago
 our pole star was furthest away then
 at angle of 23'.5 full circuit daily (IDK x2 ?)

 	it is x2 because the AXIS is then pointing at the opposite equator

		23.5' due east
		23.5' due west
		47.0' span 

		90 - 47 == 43
		47 south from pole
		55 UK
		43 north from equator
		43 Marseille ?
		43 Split 
		32 Jerusalem
		29.97937, 31.13478 Great Pyramid of Egypt

		NN EE position of Orions shoulder 

			prediction or coming galactic event
			where is that on earth surface
			(needs a map and links to internet)
			xearth - needed or GRASS open source gss maps


		so in 13K polaris will be 47' away from north
		thats something like Marseille (closer than nearby 45')

		It will daily form a circle around the axis point


		polaris is not the brightest light in the sky
		polaris is the brightest that the axis points to (crayons over)

		Maybe check the south pole for it's story
		Maybe that was known as far off tribe

		So that gives a massive punctuation in the precession cycle

		obviously it is based on shifting sands,
		and it is metaphor, acted out, asif
		and this is the point of midnight, or midday_noon, PICK one

			midnight	mid gathering
			midday noon	mid working day lunch time

		ZERO_POINT is the max alignment of the axis and Polaris 

			as the focus of the axis moves past

			we can compute 2100-06-21

	Firmament is a necessary concept, like a unit square, 
	a sphere of radius 1
	stars could fall to earth at XY_POS // maybe at TIME_ZERO

	TIME_ZERO cannot be accurately computed,
	and will inconvenience time-of-day on gregorian GMT UTC systeme
	so it can be shifted to midnight start of cal year JAN-1
	Noteven perihelion ?

	If it was possible to compute 2100 exactly
	that would be an ideal ZERO_POINT

	can use now, but need reliable 2100 date to nearest day
