		SEP is visible at CT as "_"
		SEP is visible at CT_sample_XXXX as ", "
		SEP is visible at CT_sample_XXXX
		as ", "
		as "COMMA SP"
		as " COMMA SP " // fast MATCH IDENT surrounded by SP
		as " COMMA_SP " // CT_RT MATCH IDENT surrounded by SP

		The CODE that gets written,
		does check it's own SYNTAX,
		does it's own PARSE of TEXT STREAM_PAGE _SEGMENT _STREAM_PKT

	
	SUB_LEX re-applies SUB_LEX over each fragment SUB_LEX_EXPR
	EXPR adds other nearby API // mostly done with import_Module
	BIND FAST

		The CT_RT has a JIT even for single use
		This works because we CACHE every item with own copy_one
		CACHE retains a copy of P0P2_TEXT_P0P2
		CT_RT work on same TREE detected by PARSER
		VARIOUS difference CT RT var_name var_data var_identity
