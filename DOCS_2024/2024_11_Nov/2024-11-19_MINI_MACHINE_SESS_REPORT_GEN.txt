	Editing the report scripts

	Editing the CSV data files

	Archive using YEAR_MM_DD somehow
	eg mtime of FILE
	eg git_time 


 2 focus - us here -- them there

 	there is no conflicting overlap
	but out editing here
	and their editing there
	seems to happen in time sequences not of clock OR of clock

	basically each file claims it's version
	and if that branches between 2 users
	they BOTH should merge
	(IDK maybe a diamond shape)

	until then there are independent chains of files
	our files are over here
	their files are over there
	there is very little overlap

	THIS IS A GUIDING PRINCIPAL 
	2 independent things in a shared space

	each has own GIT chain of events
	both jump V1_V2 all mid-edits // OPTI_DIFF //

REPORT

	foreach ...
	group by ...
	sort by ... // by group AUTO into list
	row_of_sums
	col_spec_wants_running_totals
	col_spec_gives_running_total
	col_spec_gives_item_value
	col_spec_gives_OTHER confusing IGNORE here but FOLLOW on_CALL

REPORT
	various ACCTS reports

		CASH_BOOK
		ACCT_EACH
		SUMS_YEAR

		ASSETS

		INCOME

CSV_DATA

	CRUD where R is above REPORTS

	CXX base used a set of SPEC_DECL just like a SCHEMA

	the WORK_FLOW of creating ESTIMATE then rolling into ACTUAL

	checking nothing lost nor gained just better facts

	git then checkpoints daily

		possibly presumes a file for each line

		a file for each TABLE // maybe TABLE.SUBSET
			
			must be sorted by PRIMARY KEYS not DBID
			must be sorted by DBID not PRIMARY KEYS

				list at [LINE] OFFS to XPOS of BOLN

				need to sweep line to get each OFFS not M1
