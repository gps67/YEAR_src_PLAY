	I have no knowledge of "game theory"

	An election should be like a bidding war.
	As the campaign days go past, there should be
	match and counter propose, but there is is't adjacent lazy.

	Instead of doing the best, which is easy to promise,
	and easy to forget, there is "do the least damage"

	For a small effort to setup and run, this results
	in the least work you have to do, cycle on cycle.

	A cycle is 4 or 5 years, maybe 1 year, and the electioneering
	is supposed to not take it over, but let actual work happen.

	Not doing any work, is the easiest lazy way of doing nothing.

	With that as the unspoken target, we can zoom in on the least damage.
	This is a counter-intuitive mother-of-pearl. 
	The shell of the oyster is lined with smooth coated hard-shell

	The repeated coating, is efficient maintenance of the effect,
	and adds to the strength and gradual resize of the shell.

	The individual out in society, is repeatedly preening away
	the slightest blemish, whist ignoring something else.

	The issue of the day, is something trivial,
	when other issues, matter even less.

	The purveyor if the individual, 
	member of society, 
	goes along with public policy, asif culture.
	And at some point assimilates the habit as their own intent.

	Clues abound, for what other issues are being neglected,
	and what else came in, under this scam's wave.

	The individual may or may not notice,
	and may or may not attach the same weight,
	or type of reaction, but one response,
	is to understand something, and either reject it or absorb it.
	Or some spectrum set of points.

	They then "get the plan", and start on it. Keen as anything.

	They then "get the scam", and rewrite it, their own way

GENERALLY

	no election policy
	no details
	only feelings,
	invoke intense emotions
	BUT
	who are you to use those tokens
