	This is not a spreadsheet, it it more like a till roll

	It is like a DB_GRID, rows and columns in a table.

	With headers, and one day with a sorted tree of group sub-headings.

	It is a bit like a document, that contains TABLES.

	Each fragment, is a DATA_ROLL, and has a list of imports and exports

	Each TABLE_ROW is iterated (after sort),
	and a list of rules are run.
	Variables are available

		ROW_PREV
		ROW_CURR
		ROW_NEXT

		ALIAS A_ROW = ROW_CURR

		K = A_ROW.vat_rate_key # auto decl { AVAR K }
		get_VAT_RATE_as_unit_mult( VAT_RATE, K ) || FAILED  # eg 1.20
		A_ROW.amnt_pre_vat = ...

		interpreter converts STMT to a list of mini_steps
		interpreter2 runs over those steps

	ITERATE over ROWS

	INLINE_MACRO AT_END() {
		// gets all vars from surroundings
	}
