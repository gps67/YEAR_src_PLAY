	Web is important, but so it TLS, and IP4, and COMMS

	TCL has a tlsbundled

	Tcl - merge same spelling - hijack that Tcl_Obj into TOKEN

		STR0 = from_P0P2

		TYPE = Module_one_TREE_ITEM_SPEC _as_SPELLING
		// ATOM became LIST ARG0 ARG1 ...
		// ATOM become LIST ARG0 // STOP CMD0 with no args

		TYPE = Module_HEAP_ITEM_FIELD_EXPR
		TYPE = see_CODE_POINT() // obtains XPOS and nearest PRESET
		PRESET CODE_POINT XPOS TYPE HEAP_ITEM

			HEAP = PICK_HEAP[idx_HEAP]

			 ANON_LIST_TO_PICK_FROM
			 [0] an_ITEM
			 [1] an_ITEM
			 [2] an_ITEM
			 [N] BEYOND_END_OF_ARGV // ARGV_N == ARGV_argc //

		TYPE {
			STR0 is IDENT 
			STR0 is SPELLING
			STR0 is ANYSTR

			PTR1 = EA_OBJ_1
			PTR2 = i64_OPTION used as ARG into CMD0

		OPCODE_on_Tcl_Obj	CALL that function NOW

		STR_SPEC_one_two	
			unlimited number of SPEC (ie memory is the limit)
			but all using a few TUPLO templates
			some use GLOBALS
	
	BEHIND_TREE_of_NAMESPACE is tepid
	GLOBAL is bold

			an_ITEM decides it wants to make a name for itself
			it reserves its own SPELLING 

			this works because first-come-first-served
			this works because ONE namespace of this SITE
