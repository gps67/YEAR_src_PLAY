		TASK_TYPE DTP_GEN_HTML_CACHED_STATIC_DYNAMIC_DEMO

			DEMO means provide DEMO DATA
			DEMO may COPY to own SANDPIT

			eg from FILENAME.tex
			GENERATE FILENAME.pdf
			GENERATE FILENAME.html
			GENERATE anything that says it depends on ASIF modified

				run those paragraphs
				which usually generates a RECEIPT of work done


			make OUTPUT files for entire project

			pick who
			pass outer 4 digit thing
			pick who with OPTIONS WORD_MODE = DAILY_LOGIN_FULL_START_WORKSTATION

 ENCRYPTED DISKS - 256 bit

 	This results in more than a single layer of encryption
	but does try to keep the CPU workload down,
	particularly for MCU_32_no_cache

	So the VFS will do one decrypt (encrypt) on every file held in VFS.
	So to read that entire file, we could have a per-file key
	to read MMAP pages something cleverly similar, one key per file

	WE can also involve a second key, in the preparation of the MAIN_KEY.

	Ultimately we do the decrypt ourselves, using some API_LIBR_CRYPTO,
	so that means we need to know the actual secret key, used.

	eg CRYPTO: METHOD AES_FOUR_with_4096_byte keys
	eg CRYPTO: METHOD AES_FOUR_with_256_byte keys
	eg CRYPTO: METHOD AES_FOUR_with_32_byte keys	<- PICK
	eg CRYPTO: METHOD AES_FOUR_with_256_bit keys	<- SAME 256 == 32 * 8
	eg CRYPTO: METHOD AES_FOUR_with_1024_bit keys	<- 
	eg CRYPTO: METHOD AES_FOUR_with_2048_bit keys
	eg CRYPTO: METHOD AES_FOUR_with_4096_bit keys

	KEY_one = secret_KEY_one_used_in_CRYPTO 
	KEY_two = secret_KEY_two_used_in_CRYPTO
	With this we dont need the




WORK_MODE
	personal login
	admin of APP_one
	admin of APP_two
	group of DESKTOP_IO_PORTS_PC_KBD_SCN_MOUSE_USB_EXTRAS

	focus_TASK_FFFF_helpful_alias_text # get_FFFF_of_alias(ALIAS)
	# return ALIAS.get_u15_idx # _FFFF # fmt_04X

		need forum to pick best C_IDENT IDENT "fmt_04X"

			fmt_04X		PERFECT

			fmt_4X		ALIAS
			fmt_04X		PERFECT
			fmt_X		MINIMALIST
			fmt_x		ALIEN

			fmt_PERCENT_04X

			// DIALECT adds _ around("%") ALSO("%%")
			// C does not interpret PERCENT
			// FMT does
			// SUBLEX manually adds "_" around PERCENT
			// SUBLEX that comes with AUTO LEX_EDGE_GAP_UNSERLINE
			// SUB_LEX ASCII_UNDERLINE _as_SUBLEX_GAP
			// SUB_LEX GAP is not a gap it is _ 
			// SUB_LEX_GAP_DETECT += SPECIAL "_" at BEGIN
			// SUB_LEX_GAP += "_" // CIDENT99 a2 includes _
			// SUB_LEX_GAP += "-" // DATE used in filename is OK
			// BUT "-" looks like math operator between 2 words
			// AMBIG // WEGHT look_for_YEAR_MM_DD_in_native
			// CERTAIN "YYYY-MM-DD" // FILENAME
			// CERTAIN "YYYY_MM_DD" // VAR_NAME
			// USAGE: of course you can request FMT2 UDEF
			// USAGE as applied by CT_RT and in SAFE_ZONE
