	SPOUT outputs PS
	It needs to know AFM font metrics

	It should Parse an AFM file,
	but it might also simply ask FT2.

	We stop short of actually printing,
	we calc the layout,
	and shuffle items around page breaks, multi column, obstacles

	We could also go via dvi fonts, but this is postscript's own world


	DIAG needs FT2 to draw text
	+= kerning_yes

	BOOK retains DIVERT for each PAGE
	a Lot of files, but swapped out memory, accessed three times,
	VFS re-maps SEGMENT to file to ITEM in heap

	P0P2 is "{ BASE OFFS NBYTES }" ...

	BASE = LOCN FILE /* PAGE_ZERO */

	OFFS = ask elf for ... // get & NBYTES from elf // back //
