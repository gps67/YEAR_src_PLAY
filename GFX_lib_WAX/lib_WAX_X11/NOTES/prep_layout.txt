prep_layout.txt

	prepare a tree of widget components
	layout each
	create X11 windows of the tree

	before the first create of actual X11 windows, each only exists as
	a callers data struct (or could mess about with not calling map())

	when each window is created, its (parent, XY, WH) is known

jiggle layout

	when some component changes, eg a scroll-bar appears,
	the surrounding layout pressures change
	and a new layout is computed

	then the actual changes are propagated
	possibly using BLIT to reduce redraws

X11 - WIN32 - SDL - FB

	common ground ?

light weight interior panels

	widget is outer frame
	all sub rectanges are (not) widgets
	single (toplevel) does it all!

	scrolled internal, can have BLIT fron backing store
