	 Layout pretends to draw the entire PANEL with INK switched off

	 	temptation to run 2 things 2 times
		OPTION single source but CT_RT provides
		CMD0 CALC
		CMD0 DRAW

		The drawing apparatus is optimised to CALC and not DRAW.
		The inline of the drawing aparatus quickly does nothing

			inline at CT_LOOP gets to the code

		 static const bool CALC_only_do_not_DRAW = false; // _rhs

		 	CALC

		Each shape has a STEP or a LIST_of_XYZ_POS

			STEP is WORD on LINE in TEXT
			STEP is LINE on PAGE in TEXT
