	HAHA! Curses and DTP

	Set dpi = 72pt/12p2 = 6 dpi vertical
	Set dpi = 150dpi screen/16pix_per_char = 10 dpi vertical

	Most of the DTP fine adjustments are set to zero
	DTP moves a CSR from BASELINE to BASELINE (L2R FLAT)
	PICS are replaced with [ABSENT]

	There is a doubble height font, in xterm 

	After the coarse-grain alignments that TTY offers
	there is a real DTP layout, same as X11, but with hooks
	lots of lan_drawing box diagrams from this side

	Can still have TimeLine axis, zoom, scroll, extra maerkers, graphs

	Can reuse mono-font-layout, adding GUI graphs within those cells
	Treat as click to grid.
	PROP_FONT_SPACING_OK works (or not, then un-set this)
