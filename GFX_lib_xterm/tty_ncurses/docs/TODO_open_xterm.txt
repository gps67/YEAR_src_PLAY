	       BAUD echo raw edit-line

	  TTY_RELAY

	      PID = TTY_RELAY_pid // The XTERM.TTY_PROG is a leaf PID
	      // this PID has the TTY (but not the central app)

	      // PPID = XTERM -e cmd
	      // can lookup /proc/$pid/fd/0 is /dev/pts/7 
	      // also readlink is "/dev/pts/7" if it will let you in

	      // or other RPC back to SESSION_CORE
