  ////////////////////////////

  PARSE XML expecting ATOM usage DIALECT

  	SECOND PASS converts TREE leaves to VALUES_in_XML

		MERGE second pass into first pass PSG 

			obtain VALUE from PARSED P0P2

			or from STREAM CSR to find P0P2 of VALUE_is_DATE_TIME

		HEURISTIC

			MATCH USAGE DATE_TIME format 
			DIFFERS

				detect consistent USAGE within TEXT
				detect inconsistent USAGE in loose DIALECT

		SPEED

			not creating STR0 for everything
			yes keeping XPOS_CSR_P1 
			OPT keeping XPOS_PLUS_FILE_YPOS_CSET // same as FILE

		SAFER

			gen PSG that is safer, even when double wrap mix

			gen PSG uses consistent GEN that humans dont
	
 FETCH RSS INDEX

 	fetch DAILY
	fetch CHECK

 CONNECT for SIGNAL

 	connect to SHARED GATEWAY (user nominates ISP as offline rep merge)
	connect as ONLINE_CLIENT _but_unattended
	fetch
	 GATEWAY suggests CSR_POS date_time_vals
	 treat received as RECEIVED
	CHECK received against previous
	 first load flag means OK no change
	 first load flag means ASIF from scratch
	 compare CSR saved, request UPDATE
	 batch future update under PENDING
	CHECK received against PENDING
	 monatonic progress, decent buffer size, no D.O.S., else WARN maybe ASK
	 process largest complete block
	 accept OPEN START BLOCK for interactive style batch under buffer
	 accept LINE is a STEP worth doing SOON
	 accept LIST of LINE worth merging into EVAL from XPOS
	  ie first PARSE inout into TREE
	  second EVAL as much as makes sense
	  third accept CSR moved a bit or completely or STALLED because

	 Every client must have an abbreviated list of updates
	  OPTION retain ORIGONAL SOURCE
	  OPTION merge all requests
	  	possibly sorted CT_RT bunches and sequences
		usually entire SCRIPT is PARSED ans as much DATA as AVAIL
	
 SERVER

	accept connection from connecting clients // does login ABSENT PRESENT
 	connect to CLIENT # NOTIFY of recent update
 	connect to CLIENT # NOTIFY of no change HEARTBEAT 99 seconds

	VAR_NAME
	VAR_VALUE _from_REMOTE
	VAR_CHANGED _remote_says_changed_WHEN
	VAR_UNCHANGED _remote_says_unchanged_upto_WHEN

	 client uses UPTO 10 second patience
	 client uses SYNC_and_SEND all // requests_REMOTE_sends_all_and_IDLE

STREAM

	ACTIVE 
		incrementally uploading PAGES of DATA and SCRIPT 
		occasionally complete set of pages enables CLOCKWORK_RELEASE
	
	COMPLETE set_of_pages
	PARTIAL set_of_pages
	COMPLETE PAGE in set
		PARSER is interactive at LINE level
		PARSER is BUNDLE_BATCH_COLLECTING MULTI_LINE LINE
	
	ASIDE

		PRE_DATA can be sent to ASIDE
		END_CODE can be run when EDGE_DETECT ZONE_BOUNDARY

			TICK_TOCK
			ZONE_CLOCK

			<ZONE>
				keep collecting until
			</ZONE>
			on_ZONE ZONE += TICK_TOCK_CLOCK // CT_ += //

FFS_FAMILY_FILE_SYSTEM

	each has own FILE space

	each can add to TREE, edit their addition, might be MASK_GONE

		MASK_as_GONE is recoverable delete
		used after monthly backup

			protect against loss - pre backup values are now FIXED
			enable delete - server usually takes burden - author too
			queue delete - aside a months of TEMPS in case of XXX
		
		used after daily backup

			protect against LOSS - daily as_was snapshots
			enable delete - queue delete of daily temps
			new clients wont have to track every TEMP mid-val

		each has edit perms, mostly from overlay

			TREE NODE += OVERLAY from SESSION

			EDIT_PERM is OVERLAY any and this time check FILTERS

		admin has edit role, especially at quarter

			QUARTER is like monthly but more formal version KEPT
	
	AQUIRED accumulated

		TREE of VITAL photos from gatherings
		TREE of NOISE from chatrooms

		push back to CLIENT that provided
		push back to CLIENT HELPER or REP or ADMIN or AUTO
	
	NOISE temporaries

		char rooms are archived forever :-) optionally
		admin filters each quarter, and ongoing gardening FS
	
	FS layout

		BRANCH owner promotes own USAGE
		CENTRAL USAGE matches / differs BRANCH USAGE

		accumulated styles and temp usage and mixed half used
	

	BULK BACKUP
	BULK TRANSFER

		each house has a quarterly BULK_TRANSFER
		already incrementally prepared
		update IMAGE to REQUEST // ie what BULK_ITEM was // PLUS then
		(SIGNAL_IS_COMPLETE_DATA)

		each house has loads of phones
		which DONT want BULK transfer archives
		but actually do use SD_CACHE and WIFI BULK_ROMS

			message selectively tag files as HERE or AVAIL
			phones QUEUE fetch when in WIFI
			requests PULLED ASAP JUMP QUEUE
	
	MOST COMMON

		all phones are fully up to date
		all traffic is light
		use BASELINE + DIFFS // replacements not diffs

		TELL_ME_LATER
			in_a_meeting - 
		POLL_ME_NOW
			checking whilst in a meeting
			switch AUTO_LOAD_WHEN_AVAIL on for 20 mins
		TELL_ME_NOW
			ON WLAN QPOS check - minimal data
			ON WIFI queue is upto date
			run the queue from already LOADED queue segment

		expect 
		RSS SIGNAL 
		 VIEW avail // news just in //

		MSG_SIGNAL
		 CURR_SIGNAL is mid conversation
