FLAX and YACC

	YACC generates lots of TOKEN for lex
	YACC includes the code that PSG generated
	YACC defines it's machine, and lots of MACRO's

	YACC generates gen_e1_yacc.tab.cc 

	YACC understands, or NOT "EXPR"
	I want some way to sneak it past, but it wont ??
	Hence EXPR is global;
	But after that, it can do anything
	It generates code than can use "NAMESPACE::OTHER" 
	for everything else

	yyparse()

	  {
	    EXPR * E = (yyvsp[-1].expr);
	    E->EXPR_branch_result();
	  }
