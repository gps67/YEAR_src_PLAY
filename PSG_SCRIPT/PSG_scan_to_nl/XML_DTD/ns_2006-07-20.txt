2. Declaring Namespaces

(see 4[11])

Attribue ::= NSAttName=AttValue

	xmlns:pfx="http://www.domain.dom/schema/name"

		this is now available, as abbrev 'pfx'

		can have multiple pfx1, pfx2 introductions

	xmlns="http://www.domain.dom/schema/name"

		this is now the default

!		you cant be clear and use "pfx:elem"
!		you must recognise "elem"

	xmlns=""

		that cancels the default

		Do I need to cancel it to use an ELEM that isnt in N_S ?

Attribue ::= QName=AttValue

	pfx:width="72pt"

	5.3: pfx2:width conflicts, if (expanded) FullNamespaceName is same

NSAttName ::|= PrefixedAttName | DefaultAttName

	NSAttName introduces a (new) namespace + prefix

PrefixedAttName ::= 'xmlns:' NCName
DefaultAttName 	::= 	'xmlns'

NCName 	::= 	(Letter | '_') (NCNameChar)*
NCNameChar 	::= 	Letter | Digit | '.' | '-' | '_' | CombiningChar | Extender


<ELEM xmlns="FullNamespaceName"> and now its the default </ELEM>
<ELEM xmlns:pfx="FullNamespaceName"> not default? pfx is defined </ELEM>

	pfx may vary between documents, but FulNamespaceName can match

	Fullname match is case sensitive

	pfx should not start with "xml" except by appointment

	this declaration can happen BY DEFAULT from the DTD !!

		a non-validating XML processor "might" not read the DTD
		"for correct operation":
			provide the declaration in the document
			maybe in the "internal subset of the dtd"

3. Qualified Names

	LocalPart	- where pfx not needed
	pfx:LocalPart

	can be used as:
		element name
		attrute name
	?	DOCTYPE QNAME	?

4.

	xmlns: as a prefix doesnt have a FullNamespaceName
	xml: has "http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" as its FullNamespaceName

5.1 Namespace Scoping

	this section is poor
		"is considered to apply"
	but then the example example fails to show any defaulting
	it has been typed again. Maybe some words are mis-translated:

	to apply -for- is available

5.2 Namespace Defaulting

	applies to this ELEM (if not already specified)

		so you have to read the atts to see the pfx:ELEM

	applies to ALL elements with no prefix (inside)

	NOT apply DIRECTLY to attributes

		muddy words

6 non-conformance of language

""
	An XML document conforms to this specification if all other tokens in
	the document which are required, for XML conformance, to match the XML
	production for Name, match this specification's production for NCName.

""

((
	use PRODUCTION QName for element TYPES and attribute names
	else use PRODUCTION Name, for entity_names, PI_targets, notations
))


A2
	attribute name

		doesnt have a type or instance
		because the clever ones didnt need such wrinkles
		Since then, its remained obvious, but floundered
		on attribute ctype fixed default value implied nonense

	element type

		really means elem_name or elem_type's name
		elem->spec->name
	
	element

		really means element instance: elem_inst
