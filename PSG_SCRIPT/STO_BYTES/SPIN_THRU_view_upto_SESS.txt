	_PREV { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... } array[ IDX ] of HEAP_IDX
	_NEXT { 0, 1, 2, 50, 15, 22, 3, 4, } # HEAP_ implied as SESS.HEAP ITEM
	_ITEM is VAR_POOL 


When TYPE gets there first, it claims "VAR_POOL" without "_t"
USAGE VAR_POOL as TYPE // as MACRO_returning_TYPE //

When SESS finds HERE, it claims "VAR_POOL" without "_t"
IT it is reject_because DIALECT does not permit SAME_NAME invoke AUTO_ADJ_NAME

BENCH can then off a fall_back EA_EXPR of "AVAR" as HEAP_LOCN_ITEM
