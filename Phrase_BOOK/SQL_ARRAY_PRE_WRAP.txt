GENERIC PATTERN
 SHAPE_one evolves to SHAPE_two
 CALLER knows but SHAPE_one does not know it has been wrapped
 WRAPPED may also mean replaced

 	eg SHAPE_one varchar(4) means 4 bytes
 	eg SHAPE_one varchar(4) += UTF8 means 4 chars which MIGHT exceed 4 bytes

	hope is it still fits in i32
	but when it doesn't we have options
	SHAPE_one might use CTRL_ASCII to bounce the STR4 away
	SHAPE_two can be found, but we want to optimise NOT looking for it
	KNOW CTRL_ASCII suggest char4 is not OK // A_B_C_NUL // because UTF8

	ask SHAPE_one to hold "we have taken over because UTF8"

		it uses CTRL_ASCII NUL 
		it is ready to agree
		it is ready to intervene when it thinks it is being used
		(when WRAP_utf8 should be used)

		see what postgres and mysql do
		point is a better SQL API CSET RULE

	KNOW requires caller to track and know	

		We have a flag3 YES_NO_UNSET KNOW_HAVE_NEED_MEH

				idea is to import a SEGMENT of ENUM
				idea is to share one_huge_enum above 256
				idea is to share i256_MINUS enum ie 64

				idea is to ALLOC place of enum in SPACE
				idea is to REALLOC and have ITEM_ZERO_idx IDX_0
				idea P0P2 IDX_0 IDX_2 B2B0 B2B0_B0
				
				idea CT_RT offers available EXPR to API
				each has a CODE_TWIG guess cost dta spec PLUS

			CT_RT is the compiler that gets the message from CT_RT

				this is a MINI_WORLD to get your head around


			OK
			FAIL
			ERROR
			BREAK
			CONTINUE
			RETURN
			THROWING
			EXCEPTION

			ON ZERO
			ON MINUS
			ON PLUS

				ALIAS ON_ZERO = ON_PLUS = EXPR

					That is a way of leaving a sentence 
					with a question
					we know it is a question
					because EXPR always is
					as well as the definitive EXPR

					CT_RT sees as CODE_TWIG
					LANG sees as VAR_NAME // and assignment


			MEH does introduce a SPEC for meh andn instance
			CT_RT tracks it, even though it is in tended to be
			NULL_MEANS_DONE_return_OK // or that STEP just did
