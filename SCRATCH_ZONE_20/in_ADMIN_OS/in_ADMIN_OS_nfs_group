	NFS not granting group access

	so created user with that name and id on server (a laptop)
	needed /etc/shadow too
	was primary group, not side list

	then group access seemed to work a charm
	without looking I'd guess
	laptop_NFS_server checks validity of user could be in group

	OK for limited LAN group of laptops each
