	T2_t T2 = get_T2_from_PANEL_MANAGER( left_panel )
	T2_t T2 =     T2_from_PANEL_MANAGER( panel_one )

		_one
		_two
		_idx[idx_N] // C adds loads to the OBJ_ITEM ARRAY
		_%s // add to VAR_POOL // VAR_POOL_one // panel_dgn_stack

		debugger ready to roll - gdb not FPC_builtin

	OPTION drop get_ 

		less crowded
		uses _from_

		nb when T2 is named and named the get_ is pointless to excess
		nb when T2 is hidden the get_ is best almost necessary

	OPTION roll RET_VAR into ARGS

	bool OK = get_T2_from_PANEL_MANAGER( T2_t & T2, left_panel )

		T2 was already CTOR ?
		T2 was already NULL !

		 means waiting for ALLOC
		 if a reference is to be kept, tie it with GROUP_KNOW_REFS

		 	GROUP does not handle ref_incr ref_decr ref_zero( ARGS )
			GROUP knows about T2 is AVAR and T2_t // BOTH //
