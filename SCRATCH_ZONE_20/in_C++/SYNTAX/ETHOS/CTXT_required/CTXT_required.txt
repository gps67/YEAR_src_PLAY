C++ requires a zero parameter DTOR

	+= this // obvs
	+= unwanted_parameters_kept_for_later // and duplicated
	+= globals // the only other way
	+= doing_without // eg PTR tells

SO
	if a struct has some { field = new CTOR( args ) }
	we MUST rely on pairing { new delete } { malloc free } { CTOR DTOR }
	we can replace new() with something that uses a different malloc
	and we can KNOW that a different free() is required,
	BUT we cant infer a required parameter

EG

	item_on_heap_in_file = special_allocating_func( heap, nbytes, flags, item );

	return the item to which heap?
	holder probably knows TYPE but not INST of which local heap file

EG 

	GC gc = XCreateGC( display, drawable, mask1, values2 )

		gc is shaped to have the same pixel depth as drawable
		gc is allocated ON display
		to DTOR( gc ) you must know which display to tell
		// simple display //

EG
