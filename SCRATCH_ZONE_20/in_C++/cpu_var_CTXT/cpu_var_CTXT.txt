cpu_var_CTXT

   the magic to make gcc reserve a register is
	register int * cpu_var_CTXT asm("a15");
   to make GCC include that everywhere, tell CPP
	-include FILENAME # on CPP cmd line
	# search = . then ... or maybe ...
	/tools/CTXT/ccs9/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.3.0/include
   to make gcc use a SPEC file ...
	place it ...
	/tools/CTXT/ccs9/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.3.0/specs
	# or invoke with -specs=$SPECS
   to get a spec file
	gcc -dumpspecs

   NOW recompile every libr linked into the binary. dlopen() too
	/tools/CTXT/ with a chroot

   HERE /tools/CTXT/ccs9 is a -prexix (like /usr/local)
   with gcc 9.3.0 built for that, (poss future chroot)
   theres nothing odd about that gcc, until .../specs added
   then EVERYTHING it compiles will reserve cpu_var_CTXT
