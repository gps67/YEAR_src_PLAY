cpu_var_CTXT

   the magic to make gcc reserve a register is
	register int * foo asm("a5");
   to make GCC include that everywhere, tell CPP
	-include FILENAME # on CPP cmd line
	# search = . then ... or maybe ...
	/tools/CTXT/ccs9/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.3.0/include
   to make gcc use a SPEC file ...
	place it ...
	/tools/CTXT/ccs9/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.3.0/specs
	# or invoke with -specs=$SPECS
   to get a spec file
	gcc -dumpspec

   NOW recompile every libr linked into the binary. dlopen() too
	/tools/CTXT/ with a chroot
