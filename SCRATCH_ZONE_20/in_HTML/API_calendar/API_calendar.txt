	Google Calendar API overview
￼
	The Google Calendar API is a RESTful API that can be accessed
	through explicit HTTP calls or using the Google Client
	Libraries. The API exposes most of the features available in
	the Google Calendar Web interface.

	Following is a list of common terms used in the Google Calendar
	API:


	Event

	An event on a calendar containing information such as the title,
	start and end times, and attendees. Events can be either single
	events or recurring events. An event is represented by an Event
	resource.

	Calendar

	A collection of events. Each calendar has associated metadata,
	such as calendar description or default calendar time zone. The
	metadata for a single calendar is represented by a Calendar
	resource.

	Calendar List

	A list of all calendars on a user's calendar list in the
	Calendar UI. The metadata for a single calendar that appears
	on the calendar list is represented by a CalendarListEntry
	resource. This metadata includes user-specific properties of
	the calendar, such as its color or notifications for new events.

	Setting

	A user preference from the Calendar UI, such as the user's
	time zone. A single user preference is represented by a Setting
	Resource.

	ACL

	An access control rule granting a user (or a group of users)
	a specified level of access to a calendar. A single access
	control rule is represented by an ACL resource.
