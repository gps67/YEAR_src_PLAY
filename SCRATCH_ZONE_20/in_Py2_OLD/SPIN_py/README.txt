SPIN_py

	An LGPL Python module that uses SP to read SGML input

	SP is 'the' SGML Parser 

	Its a bit like SAX, but completely different.
	It builds trees but isnt DOM.
	
	It also BUILDS output trees (which is handy).

BUILD:
	view SPIN_py/SPIN_py/Docs/INSTALL.txt
	cd SPIN_build_16_so_ # or other
	./M_SPIN_py
