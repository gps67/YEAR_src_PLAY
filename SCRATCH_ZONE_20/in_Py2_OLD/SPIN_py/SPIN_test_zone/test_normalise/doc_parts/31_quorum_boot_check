<H3> Quorum check at boot time </><p>
	If you reboot, with a disk missing, HPUX cannot be certain that
	the disk that works, has the proper data on it, so the LVM refuses
	to activate the LV's. When you boot via the alternate path, it
	suceeds in finding, loading and running the kernel, but when it
	then activates LVM, it fails.
</P><P>
	If you had three equally mirrored disks (what HP calls two
	mirror copies), and two disks vouched for each-other (ie showed the
	same data revisions), then HPUX would believe the two, and boot
	without the third. HPUX calls that quorum (more than half).
</P><P>
	Since you have two equally mirrored disks (one mirror copy), when one
	is down, the system wont boot, unless you tell it to avoid the
	quorum check (using hpux -lq).
</P><P>
	It is worth trying to see what happens when you dont type anything
	(ie dont boot with hpux -lq), and it only takes 5 minutes, as a
	full reboot is not necessary, it quickly drops back into IPL mode.
