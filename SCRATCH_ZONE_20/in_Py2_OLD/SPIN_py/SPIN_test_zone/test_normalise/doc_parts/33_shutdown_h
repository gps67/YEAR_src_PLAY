<H3> shutdown -h </H3><p>
	Shutdown the machine, using shutdown -h, and remove the primary
	path disk, and boot. Booting takes at least 20 minutes, because
	the system wants to check everything.
</P>

<H3> let autoboot fail </H3><p>
	First let it try its own thing, to see what happens. It will
	detect the missing pri-path disk and should return to the BIOS
	command line.
