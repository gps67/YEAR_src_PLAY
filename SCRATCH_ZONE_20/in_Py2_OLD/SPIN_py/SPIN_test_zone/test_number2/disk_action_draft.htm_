    <P>
      With a pair of mirrored root disks, you have some fail-over
      reliability. If one fails, the other carries on. If you dont
      boot, HPUX knows which is the good one, and that it <B>is</B> good.

      <A> (1.1) Finding which disk is which  </A>
    </H2>

      You dont want to pull the wrong one!

    <H3>
      <A> (1.1.1) showboot  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      On the running system, run 'showboot' to see what is set as
      the PRIMARY path, and what is probably the ALT-PATH (not necessarily).
      Use ioscan -kfn to convert numbers into device names. 
    </P>
    <P>
      Dont worry, if you ever had to do this, the HP engineer would
      do it at the hardware level. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.1.2) ioscan -kfn  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      On the running system, (or from an archived printout), obtain
      the output from <CODE>ioscan -kfn</CODE>. It helps you convert device names
      to and from device numbers. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.1.3) Disk Activity LED  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      Supposing c2t2d0 is the primary path, you want to know which
      disk that is. Simply READ a lot from the disk, and see which
      light comes on, and label it with a sticky tab. Be certain
      though. 
    </P>
<PRE>
  dd if=/dev/c2t2d0 of=/dev/null
</PRE>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.1.4) Repeat for Secondary  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      There is no need to do this, as you shall only remove the primary.
    </P>
    <P>
      It is worth remembering, that the entire disk is NOT primary
      or secondary, but that each part of the first disk is repeated
      or mirrored on the second disk. We call them that for sanity,
      but HPUX has no such concept. It has a selector variable to
      pick a disk to boot from, and LVM mirroring. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.1.5) Find an LVOL  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      If you follow this test script, (on a different system), you
      will need to know the name of an LVOL, so that you can check
      the status of its PE's (Physical Extent = 4 M track, with independent
      versioning). 
    </P>
    <P>
      You may wish to get a list of all the LVOL's on the disk that
      you are removing (and also check everything on that PV is mirrored!)
    </P>
    <P>
      vgdisplay -v /dev/vg00 will show you a list. 
    </P>
    <H2>
      <A> (1.2) Running with one disk  </A>
    </H2>
    <P>
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.2.1) Check for (no) messages  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      Run lvdisplay on a mirrored LVOL (on the disk you are looking
      at), and check that it says 'current' on both disks. Check
      syslog. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.2.2) Remove either disk  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      You can ONLY remove a disk if it is 'hot-pluggable'. BOX5 has
      its disks in the external Jamaica cabinets, with those grey/blue
      levers to pull and reseat disks. 
    </P>
    <P>
      Now remove one of the two disks, by pulling it out by 1/2"
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.2.3) POWERFAIL messages  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      Check syslog, dmesg and lvdisplay. You should see error messages,
      saying POWERFAIL (on the disk address) but the system still
      runs. lvdisplay should show errors. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.2.4) Replace Disk  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      Now firmly/gently put the disk back, and check syslog/dmesg
      until you see the POWERFAIL/RECOVERED message. That indicates
      that the disk has been seen and checked by the OS, as being
      there and functioning correctly. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.2.5) PE becomes CURRENT  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      Quickly check lvdisplay (rerunning several times) and you will
      see some physical extents change from ERROR/STALE to current.
      That is the LVM bringing both sides up-to-date. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.2.6) Now Normal  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      When that is finished, the system is fully back to normal.
    </P>
    <H2>
      <A> (1.3) Booting with one disk  </A>
    </H2>
    <P>
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.3.1) Quorum check at boot time  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      If you reboot, with a disk missing, HPUX cannot be certain
      that the disk that works, has the proper data on it, so the
      LVM refuses to activate the LV's. When you boot via the alternate
      path, it suceeds in finding, loading and running the kernel,
      but when it then activates LVM, it fails. 
    </P>
    <P>
      If you had three equally mirrored disks (what HP calls two
      mirror copies), and two disks vouched for each-other (ie showed
      the same data revisions), then HPUX would believe the two,
      and boot without the third. HPUX calls that quorum (more than
      half). 
    </P>
    <P>
      Since you have two equally mirrored disks (one mirror copy),
      when one is down, the system wont boot, unless you tell it
      to avoid the quorum check (using hpux -lq). 
    </P>
    <P>
      It is worth trying to see what happens when you dont type anything
      (ie dont boot with hpux -lq), and it only takes 5 minutes,
      as a full reboot is not necessary, it quickly drops back into
      IPL mode. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.3.2) Alternate Boot Path  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      As well as two mirrors, (of each of the LVOLS), there are two
      boot tracks. If you boot without the alternate disk, hpux might
      not notice until it tries to actives the LVM. If you boot without
      the primary path, hpux will notice straight away. 
    </P>
    <P>
      Find out which is the primary path by running 'showboot'. Find
      out which is that physical disk by reading from it and checking
      the LED. (See above). 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.3.3) shutdown -h  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      Shutdown the machine, using shutdown -h, and remove the primary
      path disk, and boot. Booting takes at least 20 minutes, because
      the system wants to check everything. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.3.4) let autoboot fail  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      First let it try its own thing, to see what happens. It will
      detect the missing pri-path disk and should return to the BIOS
      command line. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.3.5) BIOS Prompt  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      To get here without removing that disk, press the space-bar
      during booting, when it says Press-Any-Key within 10 seconds.

    <P>
      Its important to realise that there are two levels. There is
      the machine BIOS, which does not come from any disk, and there
      is an IPL-BIOS which comes from the disk. You have not read
      the disk yet. (Which is just as well, since you have removed
      it/one of them). 
    </P>
    <P>
      You can set the PRI and ALT PAths from here, or you can leave
      them and boot from a named (numbered) path. You can also do
      that from the second stage loader, or from UNIX. 
    </P>

      <CODE> SEA  </CODE>
      or 'search', will tell you the list of devices which the bios
      allows you to attempt to boot from. A recent copy of ioscan
      helps, so that you KNOW which is the tape, cdrom or disk. To
      boot an ignite tape, boot from that tape device. 
    </P>
    <P>
      (DO NOT RUN YET) <CODE>BO ALT</CODE> or 'boot alternate', will attempt to
      boot from the configured alternative path. <CODE>BO 8/8.8.0</CODE> will
      attempt to boot from that SCSI controller, that LUN device.
      (Dont do that, now, unless you want to) 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.3.7) ALT 8/8.8.0  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      The setting of the ALT PAth is not important, and may be wrong.
      You can change it if you wish, from here, from the IPL prompt
      or from a running UNIX. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.3.8) BO  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      <CODE> BO  </CODE>
      or 'boot', will probably offer you a choice of PRI/ALT bootable
      paths (disks), and also a chance to 'interact with the IPL'.
      Say 'Y' if you want to specify the -lq option later. If you
      said <CODE>BO ALT</CODE>, you wont see the first two options.

      That leaves you in the ISL BIOS, loaded from the disk. Again
      try HELP and MENU. <CODE>hpux show autofile</CODE> is like showboot, but
      from BIOS not from UNIX. If the ALTPATH is already set, life
      is a tiny bit easier, but it is often set to the tape (which
      you want to boot from for ignite), or the CDROM (which you
      want to reinstall). Commands include:

    <P>
      DO NOT RUN: hpux -lm It will take you to maintenance mode,
      but you will have to reboot, so its mostly for when you think
      you can recover the disk and immediately reboot. 
    </P>
    <P>
      <CODE> hpux -lq </CODE>
       will boot with no quorum check, which will get your entire
      machine working. You can also add the <B>-is</B> to go into single-user
      state, then do an <B>init 4</B>, but that might be confusing if you
      have no reason to do so. 
    </P>
    <P>
      If you have a second machine, up and running, try 'man hpux'
    </P>
    <P>
      Why is ISL also called IPL ? The Initial Program Loader, loads
      the Initial System Loader from disk, and then runs the ISL.
      Its similar to the way HP-CDROMS have one printed label on
      the media, and another label on the carton. 
    </P>
    <H3>
      <A> (1.3.10) hpux -lq  </A>
    </H3>
    <P>
      Boot using 'hpux -lq', and the machine will come up cleanly
      (presuming that disk was the only one missing, and other LVOLs
      wont have difficulties). Otherwise add the '-is' option and
      figure it from there. 
    </P>
    <P>
      There will still be messages about the disk not being there,
      but the other mirrored parts make it non-fatal.

      HPUX will not know its back, or even that it exists! You need
      to run <CODE>ioscan</CODE>, without the -k option (from kernel memory),
      but probably with -fn and through pg. 
    </P>
    <P>
      The HPUX kernel now knows that the device exists, but the LVM
      is still running without it. (I'm presuming the replacement
      disk is the original disk, with the old LVM info on it. If
      not, you will need to check vgcfgrestore in the manual pages
      and the Admin-Tasks-Guide -- again -- if that ever really happens
      the HP engineer will do that with you).

    </H3>
    <P>
      <CODE> vgsync  </CODE>
      is required to tell the LVM to look-for, find and re-sync with
      the disk. Notice that you didn't do that when you didn't boot.
      You must do it this time, because the LVM has completely forgotten
      about the absent disk, and is not polling to find it.
