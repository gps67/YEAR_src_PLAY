<H2> Finding which disk is which </H2><p>
	You dont want to pull the wrong one!

</P><H3> showboot </H3><p>
	On the running system, run 'showboot' to see what is set
	as the PRIMARY path, and what is probably the ALT-PATH (not
	necessarily). Use ioscan -kfn to convert numbers into device names.
</P><P>
	Dont worry, if you ever had to do this, the HP engineer would do
	it at the hardware level.

</P><H3> ioscan -kfn </H3><p>

	On the running system, (or from an archived printout), obtain
	the output from <code>ioscan -kfn</code>. It helps you convert
	device names to and from device numbers.

</P><H3> Disk Activity LED </H3><p>
	Supposing &c1t1d0; &nbsp; <!-- bug space after sdata migrated away
	--> is the primary path, you want to know which disk that is.
	Simply READ a lot from the disk, and see which light comes on,
	and label it with a sticky tab. Be certain though.
<PRE>
dd if=/dev/&c1t1d0; of=/dev/null
</PRE>

<H3> Repeat for Secondary </H3><p>
	There is no need to do this, as you shall only remove the primary.
</P><P>
	It is worth remembering, that the entire disk is NOT primary
	or secondary, but that each part of the first disk is repeated
	or mirrored on the second disk. We call them that for sanity,
	but HPUX has no such concept. It has a selector variable to
	pick a disk to boot from, and LVM mirroring.

</P><H3> Find an LVOL </H3><p>
	If you follow this test script, (on a different system), you
	will need to know the name of an LVOL, so that you can check the
	status of its PE's (Physical Extent = 4 M track, with independent
	versioning).
</P><P>
	You may wish to get a list of all the LVOL's on the disk that
	you are removing (and also check everything on that PV is mirrored!)
</P><P>
	vgdisplay -v /dev/vg00 will show you a list.

</P>
