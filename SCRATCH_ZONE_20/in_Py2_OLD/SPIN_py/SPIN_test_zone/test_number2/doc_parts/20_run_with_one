<H2> Running with one disk </H2><p>

</P><H3> Check for (no) messages </H3><p>
	Run lvdisplay on a mirrored LVOL (on the disk you are looking at),
	and check that it says 'current' on both disks. Check syslog.

</P><H3> Remove either disk </H3><p>
	You can ONLY remove a disk if it is 'hot-pluggable'. BOX5 has
	its disks in the external Jamaica cabinets, with those grey/blue
	levers to pull and reseat disks.
</P><P>
	Now remove one of the two disks, by pulling it out by 1/2"

</P><H3> POWERFAIL messages </H3><p>
	Check syslog, dmesg and lvdisplay. You should see error messages,
	saying POWERFAIL (on the disk address) but the system still runs.
	lvdisplay should show errors.

</P><H3> Replace Disk </H3><p>
	Now firmly/gently put the disk back, and check syslog/dmesg until
	you see the POWERFAIL/RECOVERED message. That indicates that
	the disk has been seen and checked by the OS, as being there and
	functioning correctly.

</P><H3> PE becomes CURRENT </H3><p>
	Quickly check lvdisplay (rerunning several times) and you will
	see some physical extents change from ERROR/STALE to current.
	That is the LVM bringing both sides up-to-date.

</P><H3> Now Normal </H3><p>
	When that is finished, the system is fully back to normal.

</P>
