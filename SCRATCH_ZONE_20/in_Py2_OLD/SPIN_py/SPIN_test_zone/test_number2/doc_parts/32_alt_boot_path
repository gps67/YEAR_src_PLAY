<H3> Alternate Boot Path </><p>
	As well as two mirrors, (of each of the LVOLS), there are two
	boot tracks. If you boot without the alternate disk, hpux might
	not notice until it tries to actives the LVM. If you boot without
	the primary path, hpux will notice straight away.
</P><p>
	Find out which is the primary path by running 'showboot'. Find
	out which is that physical disk by reading from it and checking
	the LED. (See above).
