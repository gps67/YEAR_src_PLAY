<H3> System Now Up  -- on one disk </H3><p>
	Quickly test that Informix is functioning at all, check syslog.

</P>

<H3> Replace Primary Disk </H3><p>
	Now return the missing disk, by gently pushing the lever (over
	a catch). The LED will blink, and there may even be a SCSI bus
	reset as the controller detects it.

</P>

<H3> ioscan detect disk </H3><p>
	HPUX will not know its back, or even that it exists! You need
	to run <CODE>ioscan</CODE>, without the -k option (from kernel
	memory), but probably with -fn and through pg.
</P><p>
	The HPUX kernel now knows that the device exists, but the LVM
	is still running without it. (I'm presuming the replacement
	disk is the original disk, with the old LVM info on it. If not,
	you will need to check vgcfgrestore in the manual pages and the
	Admin-Tasks-Guide -- again -- if that ever really happens the
	HP engineer will do that with you).

</P>

<H3> vgsync </H3><p>
	<CODE>vgsync</CODE> is required to tell the LVM to look-for,
	find and re-sync with the disk. Notice that you didn't do that
	when you didn't boot. You must do it this time, because the LVM
	has completely forgotten about the absent disk, and is not polling
	to find it.

</P>

<H3> stale/error becomes current </H3><p>
	<CODE>lvdisplay -v /dev/vg00/lvol11</CODE> will show you lots
	of physical extents in error or stale, but repeated running will
	show you the LVM bringing each PE back into CURRENT status.

</P>

<H3> System Now Up - on both mirrors </H3><p>
	You can now proceed, or if superstitious, you can do a full
	normal, unattended reboot, to be sure.
</P>
