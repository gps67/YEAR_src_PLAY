menu_app.py

	LGPL python scripts, that display menus and log command output

	PyGtk is the GUI

	This is an early prototype, with RunOnAsIn features,
	but C++ would be easier !

	Running from an xterm
	means you have run .bashrc - already

	Running from GNOME-DESKTOP
	means the PATH doesnt include /home/gps/bin ;-)
