The triangle has sides A, B and C

	The middle corner is a right-angle
	A could be less/same/more than B
	Presume A &lt;= B
	C is un-known-yet, but fixed from whatever A and B are

Does A have to be less than B? (or equal)

	Yes!
	You can repeat this, reflected for the opposite case.
	No!

	There is a reflection where A &gt; B
	(The animation that works on UNIX shows the effect)

	The reflection is by drawing it on transparent paper,
	and flipping it over, and re-labelling A/B.

Is the diagram correct? Does it tesselate? No gaps?

	The proof is the same as the way its drawn!
	You only use horizontal and vertical motions,
	of lengths A and B, and you finish where you started.
	No shortfall (gaps) nor overshoot (overlaps). Its exact.

	From the top:

		down A				y += A
		right B			x += B

		left A			x -= A
		down B				y += B

		up A				y -= B
		left B			x -= B

		right A			x += A
		up B				y -= B

	The diagonal "C" lines join the dots, and is the first
	time the horizontal and vertical tracks arent followed.

	(NB Python/Tk has y==0 at the top, so the above does too)

Is the little square a square?

	Its corners are 90' and the sides are the same (B-A)

	The points of the little square are NOT on the 2 points
	of the triangle, but are where the square corner meets a line.

The side length of the little square is:

	The (longer) B distance you moved to the right,
	less the (shorter) A distance you moved back to the left
	(Thats before turning south, to move B down)

	side + A = B
	side = B-A 
	(repeat for 4 sides, NB (B-A) &gt; 0 !!!)

	area = (B-A)^2 = B^2 -2AB + A^2

Is the large square a square?

	Each corner is the sum of the two angles (not the 90' one)
	If all 3 add up to 180, the 2 must be 90

	If the corners are 90, and the sides the same, its a square

	area = C^2

Do the inside angles of a triangle add up to 180?

	That needs a diagram!

	If you "drive around" a triangle, you do a full circle.
	Thats 360' of right turns (left is reflection)

	At each corner, the right turn, plus the inside angle makes 180

	P Q R are the outside right turns 
	p q r are the inside right angles

	P+p = 180	P+Q+R = 360 (the full turn)
	Q+Q = 180	p+q+r = Left-Above = 180+180+180 - 360 = 180
	R+r = 180

	That holds for any flat triangle, right angle or not.

	((Euclid parallel postulate: draw a second line parallel
	to the base line, touching the top point. P+Q+R=180.
	P,Q,R move up to the line. ))

The area of a right angle triangle is:

	rotating the triangle gives the green/white rectangle
	Its definitely a rectangle (not skewed) because
	two corners are 90', and the opposing sides are equal A-A B-B
	and the join is C (no gap)

	This also proves the two corners add up to 90'
	(for right angle triangles)

	So its half of the rectangle: AB/2

The area of a rectangle is:

	base * height	-- is this definition?

The "big square" is the sum of the area of

	the 4 triangles		 4*AB/2
	and the little square 	 (B-A)<sup>2</sup>
	------------------ 	=
	The big square		 C<sup>2</sup>

	4*AB/2 + (B-A)<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup>

expand out the terms:

	2AB + B<sup>2</sup> -2AB + A<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup>

which makes (for A&lt;=B)

	B<sup>2</sup> + A<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup>

now by symmetry, switching A and B gives the same result, so A&gt;B is OK

	that saves having a negative size square, and philosophy,
	which is just a step backwards as long as you define forwards!

	It also confirms anti-clockwise left-turns work OK.
