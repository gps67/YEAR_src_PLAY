./Makefile_parse clean

	This is how easy it is to make a shared library .so

tcl_parser_library.cxx

	a module that is a library and (doesn't) load other modules
	you shouldnt do it this way, I wish I hadnt tried
	Dont be misled, its easier than this.

tokeniser.h
tokeniser.cxx

	the module, it parses Tcl scripts -> commands -> words -> tokens

test_tcl_parser_library.tcl

	the test script, it prints tokens, words, commands, scripts

test_split_file.tcl

	This takes as parameters, a list of .tcl files, and foreach
	it produces a subdir, containing one file per proc.
	You would probably prefer to add .tcl to the filename.

	(edit the source to switch the write files on/off,
	just make sure that file mkdir $basename wont upset you ).
	
	It also produces a list of the procs, and the declared args.

module_tokeniser.h_

	the unused other half of tcl_library_xxx,
	the ideas was, I forget, and it never worked,
	but until as I have a place to move it to,
	ignore it

go1

	mc (midnight commander) is the greatest
	some people dont like it,
	probably because theyre using the X11 version

	This script puts a "button" on the ALT-F6 screen
	so that pressing Return helps debug your script.

	(( HINT: arrange your windows left to right,
	from the top of the code, chaining through ))

NOTE:

	I'm using an unreliable tcl 8.1b3
	Thats probably the cause of my bugs,
	but I'm too lazy to upgrade to 8.05 at home,
	or 8.2 or whatever.
