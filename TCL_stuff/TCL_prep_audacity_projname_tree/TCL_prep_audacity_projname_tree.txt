	Creating an audacity project is tricky because it is sqlite
	This uses old V2 text which audacity automatically upgrades to V3
	That requires the presence of the subdir where V2 data would be

	The tree of projects, uses a ROOT dir to be tidy /tmp/A_DIR
	/tmp means all your work gets deleted on reboot - so beware
	A_DIR is simply to be tidy

	L1 = ARTIST one subdir each
	H2 = ALBUM one subdir each
	T3 = PROJECT and TRACK 

	You might want PROJECT == ALBUM
	You might want different AUTO_NUMBER

	You also might want different rate="44100.0"

LIBR_one

	uses an initial draft of GEN 
	which converts "SP" to " "
	which breaks template text into words from tcl

	Needs a bit of work, but interesting
