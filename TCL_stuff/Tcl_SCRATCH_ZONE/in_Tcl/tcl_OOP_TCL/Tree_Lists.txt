The primary benefit of this is:

	Tcl_Obj * openssl_x509_cert

	TYPE_CXX subtype_openssl_x509_cert

	responds to REF_DECR (but is not Tcl_DecrRefCount)
	identifies as CXX / X509
	is a parameter to CXX functions that want it
	has a few FNS 

A primary benefit of this is:

	set obj_id [DICT]
	SET $obj_id $KEY $VAL
	GET $obj_id $KEY
	VECT $obj_id IS_TYPE ;# bool
	IS_TYPE $obj_id VECT ;# bool
	IS_TYPE $obj_id ;# "VECT"

	Tcl_Obj * obj_id
	$obj_id can be anywhere

A primary benefit of this is:

	RW -vs- RO

	A tree of lists, cannot easily be edited
	Breaking the RO rules says different
