	I accidentally did not install 9.0.3, (9.0.0)
	so I just did, and it gave some errors
	Cap1 of module for a start
	also ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS is still 8.6

	TODO try with 9.1a0

	ALSO tcltls is badly wrap packaged
	tgz is called tcltls-2.0-src 
	dir is called tcltls-20260121024900-5d3e3c3bf8  

	OOP is core dumping (maybe it was)

	TODO rework Cap1
	TODO rework Tcl_StaticLibrary
	TODO /tools/CTXT/tcl/bin/tclsh9 -> tclsh9.1
