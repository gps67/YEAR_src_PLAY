Tcl receives ARGV like list of STR0 words

We search for comma, Q1, Q2, BQ, which may share SPELLING_COMMA

We expand those few lex, via FILTER PARSE ASIF parsed from TEXT2

We develop ARGV speak, under SESS, with OPTIONS

	almost so every:
	every LEX is a locn,
	# DECODE LEX_COMMA # CT_RT callable to get_LEX get_COMMA got_COMMA

PSG_PHRASE when it arrives as ARGV_of_ARGV

	quickest way for a SCRIPT to do its job
	is no preamble, require PARSER to know

	on_EVENT_%s # group together # lookup %s # decode %s # KNOW_LABEL
	on_EVENT_%s # DECL SPEC %s #
	on_EVENT_%s # DECL AVAR %s #
	on_EVENT_%s # DECL FUNC %s #
	on_EVENT_%s # DECL HEAP %s #
	on_EVENT_%s # DECL ITEM %s #

	OBJV = on_EVENT_objv
	OBJC = on_EVENT_objc
