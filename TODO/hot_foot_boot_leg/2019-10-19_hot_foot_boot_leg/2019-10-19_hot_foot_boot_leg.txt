 hot_foot_boot_leg

	As requested by Monika,
	Here it is the bootleg special
	Theres even some steps, starting with skip

  2019-10-19_ Oct Sat 

	Kanda Bongo Man LIVE Sat night in Reading.
	I went. They sold CD's, proper quality self published ones
	I store my CD's as mp3 files, converted by hissy_fit
	So I need my own list-of-tracks-file audio.cddb
	Here is the index card for audio.cddb 

	A quick search, found videos for the songs on the CD
	A slow thought, was you migh tnot be able to obtain the CD
	So this list is ... hot_foot_boot_leg_CD

	South Street theatre put away the seating.
	There was loads of fun steps,
	Most steps simply evaporated,

	Here is the youtube bootleg list
	First create and cd into a directory Kanda
	Then edit and run this script, on a Linux system, or so,
	And it unravels

	skip-a-one		# switch direction
	LrL R L RlR L R LrL	# notation ... LrL ...
	L rL R L R lR L R L rL	# notation ... L rl ...

	Start by walking, stepping to the beat
	1 2 3 4
	L R L R

	Then after a while switch from your strong foot, to get
	1 2 3 4
	R L R L

	A single skip is one way to switch
	LEFT RIGHT
	LEFT RIGHT
	LEFT skip-LEFT
	RIGHT LEFT
	RIGHT LEFT

	RIGHT LEFT
	RIGHT LEFT
	RIGHT skip-RIGHT ...
	LEFT RIGHT
	LEFT RIGHT

	Doing that uphill, is a forwards motion, not sideways

	Moving sideways, or crab diagonal, is a lot more dance-like,
	with back all the motions, which the dance does, inexpliccable here
	Now you can add a skip

	pass it on
