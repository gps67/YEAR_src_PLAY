NFS fails with IOERROR within mc
partially copied file left

	TODO

	scan both trees, 
	 list mtimes perms wrong // size same
	 list FILE smaller
	 list FILE larger

	 offer a reverse rename that simulates broken transfer
	 
	 TODO

	 dont exit on first error
	 retry until happier
	 add a sync ? 
	 why is fsync not doing the job?
	 (it accumulates delay)

COPYOVER $d1 $d2

	all of $d1/%s is copied to $d2/%s
	currently there is no clever interpretation
	other than that

	nb d1 and d2 may need to be d1a/dir d2a/dir

###########

	cd audio
COPY	wav $NAS3_a2_AUDIO
	--> $NAS3_a2_AUDIO/wav
COPY	wav/.   $NAS3_a2_AUDIO/wav/.
COPY	wav/f1  $NAS3_a2_AUDIO/wav/.	only f1 into wav/f1
COPY	wav/d   $NAS3_a2_AUDIO/wav/.	adds "d" into wav/d/ // even -d d/ 
COPY	wav/d/  $NAS3_a2_AUDIO/wav/.	skips "d" as part of filename





	the "wav" name is then repeated into the DIR that is $d2/wav
	but a/b/c/wav is only repeated to $d2/wav

	that enables absolute $d1 paths
