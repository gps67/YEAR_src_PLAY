fill_2T
	A bit like f3
	But not as clever

	can be used to fill a disk with NUL bytes

	usually fills disk with 1K blocks (written in 32K chunks)

		u64_MARKER = 'FILL_2T' // and a NUL
		u64_BYTE_POS 
		u64_TIME_START
		u8 body[ 1024 - 24 ] // any old pattern pref not NUL
	
	also writes a progress file

		u64_BYTE_POS
	
	also writes a timings file, as ASCII

		time_to_sync_prev_block_in 
		seek_pos_of_this_block
