The key idea is a conceptual line, drawn around the code.
Inside the line, belongs to the project,
outside the line belongs to (you, maybe),
along the line is the API interface, which is open.

Self supply is considered (by me) as supply and distribution,
the programmers who work on it have been 'supplied',
so there is no loophole excuse for patent avoidence.
If you sell your company, you probably have no intention
of stripping all internal use, so that too is supply.
If you have shareholders, they can sell, and cause 'supply'.
Other people - dont worry about it - just dont look for the loophole.

REMEMBER: the patent rules apply. If you hold the patent,
and use this code, you have agreed to make the patent freely usable.
If not, you may not use this code, and that includes 'internally'.
Your own due diligence, is to yourself, to not abuse your own patent.

Please check that external components also meet your licence needs.
This project has options which use GPL'd code, ART'y licences and
OpenSSL-now-LGPL.
