### COMMON ###

	#
	# the i586 handset might not have the same ROOT_here/airbook/gtk/lib
	# as the WIN32 handset, and so these common settings
	# might need to be refactored again
	#
	# also note that the ROOT_openssl_static dir
	# is used to compile and link against
	# but might not be installed on the handset
	# add a name component 'to_build_against'
	#
	# this started out as an image of the ARM handset
	# which DOES have the .a and .h files available
	#
	# see the chroot scripts that also did something similar (merge)
