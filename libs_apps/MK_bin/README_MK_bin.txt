	MK_bin is general scripts
	These are copies of what I have in my personal $HOME/bin
	I hope they are up-to-date copies
	They should just make sense,
	and if they are completely missing or out of date
	a simple script would get you through

	TODO: drop PATH so that I dont get my copies

	PATH_TOOL is a binary - so it needs to be compiled
	it takes a VAR such as PATH and edits it, eg add DIR to PATH
	You will have to manually put the right thing in the right place.
