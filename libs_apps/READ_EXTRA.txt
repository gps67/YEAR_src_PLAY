TO BUILD
	make sure you have the source
	directly under $HOME/YEAR/
	the first run will create a build dir lib_LGX_box5

	cd _run
	./mk_lots
	./mk_less_test4

NB	This is not a ./Configure project
	you will have to do all that yourself
	see ... README ... DOS/* ...


# apt-get install libmozjs-dev
apt-get install libedit-dev
apt-get install libeditline-dev
apt-get install xorg-dev # X11/Xmu/WinUtil.h

maybe its time to add the JS source to the tree
at least until OOPL gets past the theory stage
