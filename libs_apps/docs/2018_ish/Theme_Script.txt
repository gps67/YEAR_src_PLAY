	Use SCRIPT to generate MEME

	ASK VIEW for the options picked

		WH_200x150_100dpi_on_200_dpiscreen_u32_RGNA

			// all this comes from ROM + .profile
			MEME.scheme = pallette
			// compute detail resolution into VIEW
			MEME.dpi = 100
			// but leave threshods at 100
			MEME.dpi_device = double_usual_zoom

	ASK VIEW for the ouput medium options

		PDF and SVG have 1200 dpi at 10,000 ft

		WEB.canvas probably has 120dpi, or 250dpi and NOT squinty


	DRAW OUTPUT like

		lib_CAIRO
		lib_X11
		lib_gdk
		lib_WIN32
		lib_WAX
		lib_PDF
		lib_SPOUT
		lib_DRAW
		lib_qt
		lib_gtk
