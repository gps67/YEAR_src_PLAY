then libspice
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/spice-client-glib-2.0.pc


NO GTK3 wont run on WIN32 only WIN64 VISTA
SO back to Gtk2, maybe cleanup before moving to non-gtk

	added all listed in 2017

MOVED 
	libs_apps_obj_LGX_E6320i3
	this is mentioned in MakeifleX and in mk script
	but more than one each
	some contests between ABS and REL - eg for debugger to find src
	all one big mess
	

also
        apt install libedit-dev

pdflib
	seems V7 is available GPL, V9 is available to buy
	also some notes on PDF-2.0 formalised mid 2017

	http://www.pdflib.com/
	https://www.pdflib.com/download/free-software/pdflib-lite-7/
	http://www.pdflib.com/download/pdflib-family/pdflib/

	./configure --prefix=/home/gps/prefix # match pkg-config file
	make
	make install

	2018 - seems V7 no longer promoted
	./FTP_2017_02_Feb/PDFlib-Lite-7.0.5p3.tar.gz


js spidermonkey
	mozilla is brain dead
	it is too much trouble for them to split JS from Mozilla
	so they dont
	or they do and dont tell anyone

	they also give grief reshaping the mini-tag access
	(you could pre-register attributes as a byte and find them quickly)
	told eachother on the mailing list
	but not others who visit once a year or so
	and no guidelines what to do about anything

	currently I am compiling this to make build word

	apt install autoconf-2.13 # but still not the executable available !
	visit SM site
	visit crazy grid forum
	find SM(pkg) in column on it's own 2/3 way across
	then wait for the site to do it's background thing
	then download is available, attribute of results from backend

	then ... find a web page

./lib
	does not exist within lib....uname
