	MULTI_FILE	Cluster
	MULTI_ZONE	Cluster of Zones

 PAGE_4K - not yet, get benefit of GC Clone bringing mem together

	File_Layout

		some sort of ZIP file, maybe PKT decrypted
	
	EDIT_patch

		some commands in MUX format, the patch the image

	ITEM_found

		SPEC -> CODE

	MULTI_FILE	Cluster

		ASWAS	input file ate time T_start
		PATCH	local pool used to hold patch and cache
		ASNOW


	DATA needs FILE tag, and ALLOC returns PATCHFILE

		not writing into ASWAS is skill, luck, and MMAP_RO

	MULTI_ZONE

		expand ZONE into new ZONES

		CLONE

			new ADDR of each item in one ZONE # or not
			slows down decode, except where ADDR picks

			probably defer this code ?
			or find PATCH TRIO

		MOVING pointers // really shouldnt
		INDEX[ idx ] // holds solo copy
