	That displays rows of things (version change ids)
	one or two of these things is a release
	with "SM(PKG)" 2/3 along screen
	click on the PKG # and wait 10 seconds

That pops up a bottom left panel, with tiny text

	up pops bottom left panel, + next to that
	bottom right panel, click on header Artifacts 

		it is easy to miss that dark heading
		and the text is illegible
		but it is there :-)
