HOW: fetching a recent mozjs source

https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-release&searchStr=spidermonke

scroll down to find "SM(+6)" 2/3 of the way along the screen
(x86 opt)

click on the SM, and "SM(+6)" changes into "SM((asan f nojit pkg tsan)"

click on pkg
a bottom panel appears,
the right panel has a title "Artifacts and Debugging"
click on "mozjs-106.0.0.tar.xz"

save it, (136 MB)
untar it,
that is the source
that is the binary too 
all file dates will be from 2 weeks ago,
when their version CI system checked it out, and built it
