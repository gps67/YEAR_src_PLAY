	obj_hold<fd_hold_1> fd_hold  = new fd_hold_1();
	fd_hold_1 fd_hold;

	The first one is correct, but needs fd_hold -> FUNC()
	the second one crashes but uses fd_hold.FUNC()

	It happens on DTOR of the CTXT, return of the function.
	It doesn;t even leak, it crashes.
	Cant remember what it said,
	something about the obj_list DTOR flag not set
