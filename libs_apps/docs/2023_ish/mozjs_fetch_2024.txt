HOW: fetching a recent mozjs source

https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-release&searchStr=spidermonke

	scroll down to find "SM(+6)" 2/3 of the way along the screen
	(x86 opt)

	click on the SM,
	and "SM(+6)" changes
	into "SM((asan f nojit pkg tsan)" ### SEE the "pkg" item

	click on pkg
	a bottom panel appears,

	the right panel has a MENU with MENU "Artifacts"
	and Debugging"
	click on "mozjs-127.0.0.tar.xz" // Jun 24

	save it, (136 MB)
	untar it,

		xzcat mozjs-127.0.2.tar.xz  | tar -xvf -

	that is the source
	that is the binary too 
	all file dates will be from 2 weeks ago,
	when their version CI system checked it out, and built it

see
/home/gps/YEAR/src_build/mozjs-112.0.0/js/src/doc/build.rst

	it says use "mach" not configure
	I still use configure, so ... ?
	it uses options that I dont know why 
	so maybe look at a distro build to see what they do

see + edit (same dir as this .txt file)

	 gps_SM_env
	 gps_SM_configure
	 gps_SM_make

that wont work you need Rust at a more recent level than ubuntu

	SM require 1.76 Ubuntu has 1.75 (mozjs-130)

	meh
	just copy down an old version from an old machine
	it is all JS normal behaviour

	If they were prevented from getting ahead of Ubuntu
	they would be incentivised to get ubuntu/rust updated
	instead it is all about them, little princes

Put them in $(TOP) of mozjs
Run them in $(TOP) of mozjs

	they set the install dir prefix
	they set a build dir
	they set a list of configure options - these must change !!

		they build and run, so for the time being, why meddle
		thet are probably outdated, and wrong biased

see all MK files for "gps" and "112" and "prefix"

	... logs of lots of compiling happens //
	.. 1726 seconds worth (28 mins worth)

	installed
	$HOME/G/prefix/SM/bin/js112
	$HOME/G/prefix/SM/lib/pkgconfig/mozjs-112.pc

	prefix  $HOME/G/prefix/SM/
	This allows you to move SM to one side,
	so that version (112) is this dir alone
	you may then need to cd SM/bin ; ln -s js112 js
	and maybe even link that somewhere on yout PATH

	you then need to use pkgconfig PATH + ITEM # uses mozjs-112
	that is also in the SM prefix,
