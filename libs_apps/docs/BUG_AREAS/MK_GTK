If the app loads with no available fonts (all buttons empty and small)
and you are getting this message:

** (tv_rem:30707): WARNING **: No builtin or dynamically loaded modules
were found. Pango will not work correctly. This probably means
there was an error in the creation of:
  '/tools/2003/gtk/etc/pango/pango.modules'
You may be able to recreate this file by running pango-querymodules.

LOOK IN /tools/2003_obj/gtk/pango-1.2.3/examples
EDIT

If the pixsave fails check  gdk-pixbuf.loaders

/tools/2003_obj/gtk/gtk+-2.2.2/gdk-pixbuf
/tools/2003/gtk/etc/gtk-2.0

sed -e 's,/tools/2003/gtk/gtk+-2.2.2/gdk-pixbuf,/tools/2003/gtk/lib/gtk-2.0/2.2.0/immodules,'
