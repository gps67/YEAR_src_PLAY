PDF run_report seems to crash on the second report
Something isnt completely released
Use a forked process, and run two different ones

Symptom:
	title intro page is flattenned to 1 line
	as if font height == 0 (never advances)
	at bottom of page - why not top ?
	something about reloading fonts
	probably my code

Symptom:
	xpdf says:  Error (3704): Too many args in content stream

	commented out second line in JavaScript scipt

CODE: CLASS: pdf_ctxt

	PDF_new2(...)
	PDF_delete( pdf )

	these ARE being called exactly once (twice)
	maybe should retain one context
	maybe should check that PEN's are also deleted

CLASS: pdf_base0:

	holds a pdf pointer, but obtained it from ctxt
	and is inline for rapid turnover (single ponter ideas)

	... tired ... run twice
