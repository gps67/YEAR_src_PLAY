destroy has changed, it is now necessary to retain a reference to
an object (otherwise w_widget0 destroys the gtk object).

It is also necessary to react to event_destroyed() (after connect),
to know when things have disappeared.

Also some redraws happenning during de-construction phases,
maybe jumping to the top object would make that invisible.

Or as was ...

gtk does ALL the ref-counting from when the widget is packed.
For some reason it doesnt delete the w_win_top (MainWIndow) object,
probably because that isnt 'packed' into any container, but gtk_main_exit
should know better.
