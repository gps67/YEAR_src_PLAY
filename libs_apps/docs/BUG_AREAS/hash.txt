ht1 and reference counting

	There is a major issue with ref counting,
WANTED:
	gtk knows to call the delete functions itself
	which call ref_decr(), as in:

	GHashTable *
	g_hash_table_new_full(
		GHashFunc       hash_func,
		GCompareFunc    key_equal_func,
		GDestroyNotify  key_destroy_func,	// F_del_key
		GDestroyNotify  value_destroy_func	// F_del_val
	);

GTK1:
	gtk1 seems to lack this function?

GTK2:
