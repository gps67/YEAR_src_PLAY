mk lots

	calls install _to_dir
	which calls install -p over (what was) a symb link
	that leaves you with 2 copies of the file
	/home/gps/lib/libbase2.so
	/home/gps/2000/src/libs_apps/lib/libbase2.so
	-ditto- libbase2_gtk
	-but- cant see why it doesnt also happen for libbase.so

	This will drive you potty until you see it, or it is fixed
	it varies on where you run the command
	changing the source doesnt change the action
	then at some stage it does ....
	mental !!!
