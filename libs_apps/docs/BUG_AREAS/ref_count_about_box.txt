the error / help-about box does not have a proper owner
rewrite so that there is ONE owner for it
rewrite so that the C_dec_ref is as it should be

I think I may have corrupted the C_dec_ref logic
I know that I forgot to place an obj_ref<w_dialog_box> anywhere

This is a wrinkle from when obj_hold<w_items> was rolled out
The unknown dialog box didnt get patched
I then went crazy with c_dec_ref a,d messed that up

There is a point when GLIB / GTK telly you your object
is about to go out of scope, but exists enough to dismantle DTOR

There is a point after the DTOR when you CANNOT touch that mem,
but maybe there is a callback for drop-hot-potatoe-pointers
and I am confusing the two (probably badly nmed IIRC)

------------

A similar issue, is to replace all calls to functions,
that return a value, to put it into a slot instead

	T * newitem = mk_me_a_thingy(args)


	obj_hold<T> my_item; // NULL
	mk_me_a_thingy(my_item, args) || return FAIL_FAILED();
	
	bool mk_me_a_thingy( obj_hold<T> & my_item, ... ) { ... }

Then if it is a plain string you want,
give it a buffer to use for memory

	buffer1 buf;
	buf.clear();
	STR0 day_of_week_name = dow_str( buf, args );

or more specifically

	buffer1 buf;
	buf.clear();
	buf.print("left hand text";
	print_dow_str( buf, args ) || return FAIL_FAILED()
	buf.print("right hand text";
