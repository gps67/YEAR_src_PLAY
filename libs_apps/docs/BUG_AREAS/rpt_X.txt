In the reports (pdf, ...)
when there is a category S0, which is category 'S'
the sub/totals is all askew

	I think its due to the presumption that there are no TRANS rows
	in the TOP data level, and all sub S1/S2/S3 categories get summed
	into it.

	In one of the data files, that isnt the case, and there are X0/X1
	(in another there is ONLY X0, and that is different)
