The time-series merge-floats (eg dset_api_pdb) DEMANDS properly aligned
times, otherwise it goes into a spiral crash.

I.E. If the command samples every 5 seconds, but starts 1 second after the
minute, you must adjust the time (lie) to align on 5 second edges.

This also means that dt makes better sense as a divisor of minutes
(though it doesnt matter, it just looks odd when zero is 1970).

When writing your data parser, particularly for time-series,
note the set_t0() and align in tbl_collect;
