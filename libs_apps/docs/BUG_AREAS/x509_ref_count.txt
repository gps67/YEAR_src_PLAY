SSL has its ref count on x509 certificates
the problem occurs when copying using deleting
it is not clear WHEN ssl has created a copy for you and when not
there is a ref count printer (look for leaks)
so setup a unit test case, and call before after calls to ____get_cert?___

I think this happens when creating certs for CA,
which is when most programs simply save and exit
