Build.txt
---------

You will need:

	mc # midnight commander - dir/file browser
	JavaScript Source (or -dev.rpm)
	Gtk2
	libpdf
	mysql (opt)
	postgres (opt)
	ssl
	LIRC
	xawtv
	doxygen

You must create some symb-links (adjust from /home/gps/2004/src/)

	cd /home/gps/2004/src/

	# doxygen can place lots of things, ../dox/ sibling to ../src/
	mkdir ../dox # /home/gps/2004/dox/ # for doxygen

	# where the objects will be placed
	mkdir libs_apps_obj

	# the simplified dirname
	ln -s libs_apps-2005-01-31/ libs_apps

	# add to PATH or link to where it will be found
	ln -s /home/gps/2004/src/libs_apps_obj/js_many /home/gps/bin/

You must tell MK/Makefile where things are 

	edit MK/Make_UNIX	# and the others
	edit MK/Makefile
	# change  TOP=/home/gps/2004/src/libs_apps

You need a directory where the objects go

	mkdir obj_sky_2	# except replace 'sky' with your hostname

You start the build from here:

	cd _run
	./mk -k lots	# wrapper that calls make

You need some sample date files, and invocations

	browse samples
	grep test MK/*

JavaScript:

	http://www.mozilla.org/js/
	ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/
	js-1.5-rc6a.tar.gz # or whatever

	https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript_C_Engine_Embedder's_Guide

	cd js/src/
	make -f Makefile.ref
	# copy .so .h edit above makefile to say where

You may want to setup some SQL databases

	browse sql

Some of the source is not that bad

	browse src/dir/dir/file

doxygen

	cd _run_dox
	less _incl_path # generated by Makefile, check it looks OK
	
	./MK_clean
	vi ./MK_doxies
	# change  DOX0=/home/gps/2004/src/dox -- or the later if false dox1=
	# change  TOP=/home/gps/2004/src/libs_apps
	./MK_doxies
	./_DOX_run.sh
	less _doc_WARNINGS_*

doxygen

	cd _run_dox_1
	#
	# as above
	# this dir is better as it does it all in one
	# the above splits it into "libraries"
	# but that doesnt quite work so well
	#
	./MK_clean
	./MK_doxies
	./_DOX_run.sh
	less _doc_WARNINGS_*

You might want to compile things outside of this tree

	browse include # I dont use this dir, but you might
	browse MK_ext_lib
