The new WIN32 build is not MINGW on WIN32
It is a cross compile on Linux.
You might have a choice of IMCROSS or linux-cross-mingw (ubuntu std)
see MK/Makefile_X_WIN32

The LGX and ARM and WIN32 ports use pkgconfig
particularly for modules that link against libs_apps/libs/libbase2.so

The multi-way build matrix, and make local install,
is all a bit convoluted.
Particularly with non-standard packages (eg openssl) to link with.
The build system might be ubuntu, but the target might not be.
