Suitability

	single directors journal, more would add too many columns

	few items, no till roll - separate module ?


		that module could be this software, folded in,
		but you would have a lot of inputs, and need 
		categories per row, from a POS till.

	Simple transactions - no part payments, full refunds only, etc

		if you need splits/joins you will have to iterate them

	The GUI is all wrong, the PDF are nice though.
	I use a plain-text editor, or another mm3 source.

Not Double Entry - but not far off

	each TRANS has a cash amount and a category
	The category acts as (an alternative to) the doble entry.

CashBook and Categorised Reports

	The cashbook is sorted by date (and uses date_pay),
	the Categorised is sorted by category (showing date_tax).

Single Category

	My transactions are simple, they are (mostly) one item.

	I dont have to deal with part-payments, or splits/joins.

	VAT calculations apply to the entire row at a single rate.

	If that doesnt match, you will have to split it down to
	constituent rows where this would work (and maybe add some
	common group-row-id.

Polarised Hierarchical Categories

	Catagories exist in a tree of categories.

	All transactions in a subtree should be polarised income
	or outgoings. This is important with turnover.

	Refunds are obviously the negative of the usual polarity.
	There should be some flag against contra-polarities,
	and also discrepancies in VAT categories, but visual is OK.

	Its OK to have a sub-sub-brack that is used for specific values.

	At the top is D-T-O-X-I-N

Negative amounts

	a positive amount is good for the company
	a negative amount is bad for the company
	the CASH value is counted, (the goods arent)

	Other systems, originating from times when negative numbers
	were impossible (or the devils work), have plus and minus
	pages, income and outgoings.

	If you are used to negative liabilities, then it may appear
	strange, but is the cash value good for the company?

	Other sub-systems, such as payroll, might have its own
	polarity (good/bad for the employee), but it imports properly.

Ambiguous Polarity

	I've forgotten, but there was some case which I always
	put in one direction, but could be done alernatively.

	It might have been a TAX throughput. (TBS)

Zero Transfers

	a transfer, is intended for movement of cash between
	real bank accounts, and also unreal-journals.

	Close scrutiny goes to transfers between internal (bank)
	accounts, and external (debt) journals. They have zero
	value to the company, bu might move chunks of cash into
	or out of the company. In paractice, these are the sum
	of lots of accumulating bits, settled in big (zero) amounts.

Immediate cost - Not Barter

	In line with UK accounting, most purchases
	are "immediately" written off as costs/expenses.

Assets transactions

	"hardware" is considered as asset purchases,
	they have a 2-in-1 bi-directional value, added to
	the asset account, which devalues by 25% annually

	ie types of transactions are:

	XFER = TRANSFER

	TRANS = Transaction

	TRANS.out.asset = asset purchase (not quite an expense)

	TRANS.in.asset = asset sale (rare event here)

	TRANS.in.asset_depreciation = asset depreciation (sudden expense)


Acrued -vs- Cash assets

	Proper assets have special treatment (auto credits into asset account)

	Minor deferments are carried by two-dates

	Accrued - means entire amount costed at date_tax

	Accrued - should mean long-term costs, divided over time.
	This doesnt happen. Maybe they could be reported on-top-of
	(not part of) the accounts.

	Things like annual insurance, might have a carried over value,
	but these are low for me, and cash-accounted. There is
	always a working envelope, with annual momentum in annual
	accounts. Monthly sub-totals might differ.

	TODO: add a spread field, with tokens (enum) for

		spread_value_over_the_following_12_months
		spread_value_over_the_containing_12_months
		spread_value_over_the_containing_month
		spread_value_over_one_day_or_so
		spread_value_over_three_month_or_so
		spread_value_over_the_following_24_months
		spread_value_over_the_following_36_months_see_schedule
		spread_value_over_the_following_5_years - standard office equip

	UK has a "default" office-equipment depreciation of 25%,
	but does have some extra rules for the first year. This
	rather stupidly (jobs for the boys) distinguishes BOOK value
	from TAX value. Whats the point of having special allowances,
	if they arent actually real?

Double Date

	Every row has both: date_tax, date_pay

	The difference between them, (eg time for a cheque to clear),
	should be tracked as an amount of money, held by the row itself.

	Mostly, I dont have this as a problem, and only pay attention
	at the year end, when I bounce them through some i/o journal.

	You caould add extra code.

VAT multiples

	I have used othere schemes where you can type an actual amount
	paid, but I only have specific percentages, applied to the row.

	If you have a group of rows that need different rates, you will
	have to split them into individual rows. ((HINT the group and
	the subs must not be BOTH counted, one must be marked as INTERT.
	All rows in a group, can be joined with a group-id field.

VAT Journalling

	Each individual row, is added to the running total journal.
	Every 3 months, that is reported, and a row generated to 
	XFER the total into a second journal (t=tax) which is then
	paid 4+1 weeks later. The first running-total-journal is
	supposed to hit zero every 3 months, unless new rows
	have been found/lost. its a shame that HMRC dont do a
	re-declaration after the year end, to make things match up.
