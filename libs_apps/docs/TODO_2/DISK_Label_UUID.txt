Too many Machines: (Crowd Computing)

moved primary disk from X3 to X2
where it joined a pair of disks
(and lost the cdrom?)
and lost X3B (not plugged in)
and lost /ROOT6/ (which was reformatted f18)

Want a global (site-wide_ configuration of UUID and LABEL
Want to configure /etc/fstab
((want to kill modal gnome update manager stealing focus))
Want readability, uniqueness, etc, etc
UUID is a bit rediculous, maybe recode with OWN values

GRUB also uses UUID's

-----------

GRUM merge
 multiple OS's - a subdir each ?
 multiple FIRST disks (turned out SAT-3 was X3 disk one)
 merge-abilty
OR do via kexec, GUI, mount disks, etc
SO that makes HW like VM,
++ manage list of containers, moving around
