insight
	a gui over gdb
	it has been abandonned by cygnus
	it has not been upgraded to gdb annotations version (latest)
	it could be fixed to use binutils, but it hasne been

	so use ICC instad og FCC and see things that dont work

	when a fault happens, the stack is three deep 
	from the sleep interupt handler
	there is not an answer
	use gdb text mode (it knows itself, PATH uses latet version)

	use gdb_invoke(true)
	it LOOKS like the three deep function stack
	but continue then trips over the subsequent LINE:
		************
	where you can then put a breakpoint further up and Continue

WHY IS IT SO GOOD

	eclipse uses tiled sub-windows
	insight uses overlapping windows
	so you can arrange an excess of information
	and still see the left of a covered panel
	and it still works
	also insight can remember its window layout which helps

WHY insight is a tad wrong

	not updated (ie it doesnt work)

	C++ structs appear as public+
	so you have to click to open, click to open, etc
	that also uses a lot of screen estate

	something to do with array pointers not visible

	something to do with non-standard strings, are hard to view
	(as are buffers used for text)
	thats why I have char[30] * sneaky_peek = buffer;
