	If you have several, try the nearest without a hill in the way

	Distance (and line of sight)
	15 miles = loft OK, loft costs 6db!

	CABLE: WF100 - inside and outside

	That tells you to get an aerial that is tuned to group B,
	but most aerials are wideband (not grouped).

	Horizontal wires is normal, vertical is turned 90'

	The compass angle (magnetic or geographic?) is clockwise
	so a bearing of 302 means pointing NW

	HINT: use the building wall, and make a piece of paper.
	The compass will be of no good when the aerial is close by.
	Or a protractor. (Assuming the building is mostly square).

	The name is a key to other tables of transmitter data

	HINT: Buying Aerials
		the group is wideband 21-69
		an end mounted aerial points anywhere, but leverage
		forward gain 10..15 db
		MaxView MX30
		Fracarro Omega 5
		Fracarro Omega 8
		Maplin A21GY688
		Standard 2 = CAI second best

		http://www.dtg.org.uk/publications/books/cai_dtg_bmrk_aerials.pdf
		http://www.highdefinitionuk.com - others exist !

	HINT: non directional aerials
		these dont look like aerials
		more like aerofoils
		but need PSU/240

	HINT: Fitting Aerials
		an end mounted aerial points anywhere, but leverage
		use better screws or bolts on old walls
		use a better bracket (multiple points on pole)
		use a masonry drill bit not a wood bit
		wet the hole, use some PVA to waterproof + hold
		cut a piece of paper to the angle
		use a compass to get the agngle of the building
		angle your aerial before fitting bracket!

Add your own devices

	69	Freeview to TV
	60	VCR to TV
	...	may be configurable (avoid digitals!)

	Remember - SCART is better, but not to my PC card!

Edit .xawtv

	Put the analogue frequencies (channel numbers 21-69)
	into xawtv. Then try fine-tuning.

		# eg add this stanza 
		[44-One]
		channel = 44
		fine = +9

	NB The digital muxes are not in xawtv
	they are in your Freeview box (or RSN card!)
	but do avoid setting your VCR over them!

Check Your FreeView Box

	Each MUX carries several channels in a group.
	If you cant get a frequency, or its weak,
	several channels will be unreliable

	http://www.dtg.org.uk/retailer/dtt_channels.html

	MUX1 = BBC1 BBC2 BBC-Three CBBC BBC-News-24 BBCi Radio-wales
	MUX2 = ITV1 FOUR ITV2 ITV3 C4+1 ...
	MUXA = S4/C Five UK-Gold Radio-4
	MUXB = BBC-Four CBeebies Radio-7
	MUXC = Sky-Three UKTV-History E4+1 ...
	MUXD = Hits TMF ITV2+1 Film4 ...

	The same table also gives the LCN that the viewer sees

	Different MUX-frequencies will bounce off walls and through trees
	differently. The settop box probably shows signal strengths.
	Hence groups of channels fade off when the leaves grow back.
	The actual (latest) MUX layout will be on the web.

	You might be the manual tuner of your PC-DVB

Buying PC-DVB

	USB - can be used in laptops
	PCI - fewer cables
	Linux - 
	(I have no cards)
