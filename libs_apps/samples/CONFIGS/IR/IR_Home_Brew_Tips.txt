Home Brew Tips

I tried the simple circuit shown on the www.lirc.org website,
and I didn't regret it, but I had a few questions on the way.

Circuit
-------
The 1N4148 diode has a black line on the - side (8 pence)
The LD271 IR_LED has a longer wire on the + side (49 pence)
A 1.2 K Resistor works with a reasonable but low (1 foot) radius (7 pence)
The com port plug and wire cost 150 pence !

COM1 DB9 pin-4 is DTR (the + side)
COM1 DB9 pin-5 is SG (The - side)

COM2 DB25  pin-20 is DTR
COM2 DB25  pin-7 is SG

Pointing the LED at multiple devices is tricky,
but a surrounding bit of white plastic bag
spreads it around a bit (Theres scope for
a piece of living-room artwork here ... )

This is a really simple circuit, see:

Configure and Compile
---------------------
setup.sh must have softcarrier set, as must the module
My production options in configure.sh are:

	./configure \
	--with-module-dir=/lib/modules/2.4.23/misc \
	--with-transmitter \
	--with-x \
	--with-driver=serial \
	--with-major=61 \
	--with-port=0x3f8 \
	--with-irq=4 \
	"$@"

You will need a second version of lircd (but not irrecord) with
debugging compiled in.

To build the debugging version, copy the entire subtree to lirc-0.6_DEBUG,
edit .setup.config to set DEBUG=on, run setup.sh, select configure, make

Test with xmode2 on a laptop
----------------------------
It helps to have a laptop with an IR port to run
xmode2 to see that signals are emitted, and run irrecord
to get the signal data, but it is slightly less sensitive
than domestic devices.

lircd -D with debugging compiled in, and a partial lircd.conf
shows unrecognised codes, to cut+paste in. (if it doesnt show much,
run irrecord on a COPY of the file, then edit across).

irrecord with debugging compiled in on an existing file,
doesnt record extra buttons, it exits immeditately
(so you need two sets with/out debugging)

irw shows that buttons have been recognised
(remember to restart lircd -n -D testing.lirc after editing)

Install
-------
/etc/rc.d/init.d needs to run  "lircd"
/etc/lircd.conf holds the specs of the remotes (cat'd together).
/etc/logrotate.d/lircd will clip the /var/log/lircd logfile

My /etc/modules.conf contains:

# home-brew IR
alias char-major-61 lirc_serial
options lirc_serial irq=4 io=0x3f8 softcarrier=1
pre-install lirc_serial /bin/setserial /dev/ttyS0 uart none

I havent any voltmeter to check the load on the serial port,
and might be risking the MB circuits, but for me its well worth it.
