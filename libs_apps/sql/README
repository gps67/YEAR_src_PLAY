sar_plot no-longer requires Python,BLT,Tk (it now uses Gtk)
but Python is very useful for DB tasks. Since there are two
databses (when you have one), you must edit the scripts to
select which one you want to use, then aim for a common api.

You also need PyGreSQL-3.2 or  MySQL-python-0.9.1

The Python scripts are very out-of-date, and follow some absurd
design, probably what the old plotter required?
