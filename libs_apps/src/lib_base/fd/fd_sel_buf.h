/*!
	This is a base class for fd_sel_ssl

	This is a base class for fd_ssl_{client,server}

	When they receive a PKTIN, they keep the data in the same buffer
	(still trying to reduce that, but double buffering is tricky).
	So to pass the PKTIN to the application (eg another to write out),
	they pass "this", as the base class fd_sel_buf.

	EG a 'telnetÂ´ over SSL, would recieve screen data from the remote,
	and write it to the TTY fd (itself another buffer). Any activity
	on the keyboard fd would get written to the fd_sel_buf.out_buf.

	The amount of space available is that which is in fd_sel_buf,
	possibly it might have a spillage area, and then it is XOFF.

	'in' and 'out' are from here out via the SSL box out on the wire
	(or in).
