MAYBE THIS IS NOT FIXED - and I forgot to update the docs

	The archeological view,
	found in w_container_.cxx
	is that the copy constructor,
	was not setting ptr=NULL;

	Since this is now happening,
	and it is not crashing (or is it?)
	I should hunt for all double stepped places, and change them back!

	Of course if it isnt fixed ...
