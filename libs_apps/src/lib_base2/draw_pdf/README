PDFLIB is semi-free software from www.pdflib.com
You can use it in GPL projects (which the top level is, the rest is LGPL)

This directory is how I CALL pdflib, and could easily be converted
to another PDF generator, (or postscript), if anyone can suggest one.

I compiled with pdflib-4.0.3, but on WIN32 I needed a patch pdflib.h,
and for convenience it is included here as pdflib_h_PATCHED.gz
but only until it works out of the box.

CHANGE: I now compile against PDFlib-Lite-6.0.1 TODO: test with WIN32
That is without any patched inclusion of pdflib.h

A strange but interesting feature in my code, is that each pen is 'readonly'.
If you want another font or colour, create another pen. There are still
bugs in the style-selection-switching, but the calling code isnt involved
in much detail.

axes_calc provides a page of size 1.0 x 1.0
with Y increasing downwards (through a -1 scale factor)
You can (almost) create sub-areas, again with a mapped 1.0 x 1.0,
or whatever you like. FONT dimensions are automatically scaled,
and this really flushed out my old X11 habit of x_pixel += 1.

BUG: there is a 'one-shot' problem, where the second report font HEIGHT
metrics are zero, and all output is overlaid on one line.
This is probably due the destructor/constructor not being correct,
and pdflib not reloading, cached things, now set to zero (??)
RESOLV-ING: seems that the SECOND constructor of pdf_rep_0 
fills in with NAN, so y_pos += anything is still NAN
