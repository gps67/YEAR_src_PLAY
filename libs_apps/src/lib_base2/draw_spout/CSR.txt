	Writing to the CSR is writing to the document
	They are _ALMOST_ the same thing

	There is only ONE csr, MAYBE
	There might be a stack of frames
	There might be a separate OFF_PAGE renderer,
	then folded back in,

	Like a PRINT_HEAD the csr holds one pen one gc or a selection
	That is then on the DOC

	CSR_t 
	+= weak link to DOCUMENT
	+= link to PAPER 


 PEN + INK
 SURFACE PAPER
 VAPOUR_PAPER	== like a divert to PREP pixmap, mixed format
  eg TrueType might write to u4 grey pixmap
  nb how does that match transparent? opaque FG over clear BG BnW_grey

 SURFACE_DEPTH and other characteristics
  RGBA
  RGB
  RGB = pallette[ u8 ]
  RGB u5 u6 u5 # probably not supported # u16 # 
  B/W 
  u4 antialiased GREY over FG/BG B/W
  SOMETHING on GPU CARD MEMORY or
  SOMETHING on CPU MEMORY or
  PIXMAP WH all of it
  PIXMAP XYWH on pixmap XY maybe with CLIP maybe we are clip
