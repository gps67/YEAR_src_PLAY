Multiple g_io_add_watch_full() on win32, last one wins.


I want to create (3) multiple watches for G_IO_IN, G_IO_OUT, G_IO_others,
so that I can unsubscribe IN and OUT independently. (PRI|ERR|HUP|NVAL).

It appears, that only the last watch created is handled properly.
If G_IO_OUT is the last watch created, it is called when connect()
happens. Otherwise it is never called. In that case G_IO_IN's
watch is never called.

I have a single source file that works fine on UNIX,
but fails on WIN32, and also varies with the order of watches.
g_io_channel_win32_set_debug shows a loop without anything matching.
It comes with a makefile that needs IMCROSS and PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
It gives similar results on XP-SP2 and on WINE.

	g_io_channel_win32_new_socket()
