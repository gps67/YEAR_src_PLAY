Setting Insight Debugger on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
April 23, 2016 	by dalfonso_co  3likes 	49 Comments
After the removal from Ubuntu, there were attempts to get it back. The best solution comes from Patrick Monnerat, that made a  build that bundles GDB. The result is quite good, and will make happy any person missing insight.

The git repository is now on the sourceware site, as the great job of Patrick was included in the original location of  insight in the sourceware location.

If this guide was used in the past, please be sure to update the repository for future pulls as it is listed in the current version of this post.

￼

It required a little to put together all the dependencies and the following are the steps followed the get that working.

General
sudo apt-get install autoconf
sudo apt-get install autogen
Dependencies for Bfd
sudo apt-get install texinfo
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
Dependencies for libgui
sudo apt-get install tcl-dev
sudo apt-get install tk-dev
sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
sudo apt-get install libtogl-dev
Dependencies for GDB
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install flex
sudo apt-get install bison
sudo apt-get install itcl3
sudo apt-get install itk3
sudo apt-get install iwidgets4
Get the latest version
git clone --recursive git://sourceware.org/git/insight.git
Run autoconf
In the home of the cloned repository run the autoconf command:
netshark@NAUBVM01:~/insight$ autoconf
Create a configuration script (here insight.sh)  in the home of the cloned repository containing the following command: ./configure --prefix=/usr/. \
--libdir=/usr/lib64 \
--disable-binutils \
--disable-elfcpp \
--disable-gas \
--disable-gold \
--disable-gprof \
--disable-ld \
--disable-rpath \
--disable-zlib \
--enable-sim \
--with-gdb-datadir=/usr/share/insight \
--with-jit-reader-dir=/usr/lib64/insight \
--with-separate-debug-dir='/usr/lib/debug' \
--with-expat \
--with-python \
--without-libunwind
Change the file attributes
netshark@NAUBVM01:~/insight$ chmod +x insight.sh
Run the script (here named insight.sh)
netshark@NAUBVM01:~/insight$ ./insight.sh
Run make
netshark@NAUBVM01:~/insight$ make
Install insight
netshark@NAUBVM01:~/insight$ sudo make install

Simply want to say your article is as astounding.
The clearness in your post is just nice and i could assume you’re an expert on this subject.
Well with your permission let me to grab your RSS feed to keep up to date with forthcoming post.

Thanks a million and please keep up the enjoyable work.

I’m a total newbie to Linux and recently picked up Jeff Duntemann’s Assembly Language Step-by-Step 3e to self-teach assembler (in hope of better understanding and mastering C++ next). Unfortunately, my computer is x86 64bit based so I had to do extensive search on how to get my Ubuntu 16.04 to acquire the correct softwares to follow Jeff’s instructions. Thank you so much for putting together means to get Insight to work on newer releases of Ubuntu. But for a newbie like me, who’s never learned of Linux terms like “clone”, “repository”, and who’s only heard of github.com for the first time, everything went pretty well ’til step 5 when I copied what I thought was what you meant into my terminal command line: “git clone –recursive https://github.com/monnerat/insight.git” and clicked Enter. What I received in return was an error message “fatal: repository ‘–recursive’ does not exist”. After another hour of desperate search online, I finally came to realize in Linux, hyphen (“-“) and en dash (“–“) make huge difference…

Hi,
yes, thanks for pointing that, the --recursive is correct, I made the fix in the article. Thanks.
There is some issue with formatting, with this font style, and still showed as a single — long one, before setting it as “code” but now it should be clear.

Now it works, with the command set with the “code” format

Thanks
Did you get the result working, following the guide?

Yes! Insight has been installed successfully in my system now, following your instructions. Many thanks! One more questions though, I don’t know if it’s just me but when I try to search/launch Insight (as well as Kate editor required by Jeffs book) from Dash(and software/app center) in my Ubuntu 16.04, nothing shows up…
The only way it seems I could get Insight launched was through terminal command line..
(I did lock Insight onto my launchpad now to get around the issue. but I am still curious why it happens to me because it seems like other people don’t really share this problem. Did I miss something here?)
Thanks again!

re: Jin

I’m having some difficulty getting programs setup for ALSBS by Duntemann also. Seems a lot of changed have occurred with Ubuntu since the latest release of the book. Wondering if you were able to get sessions working in Kate and how you did it. I’m running Kubuntu 16.10.

Hi,
Sorry for the delay, I never used the pinned version as, usually, the debugger is started with a built executable ready to be analysed. Also, if the current version is a bit more pleasant and can promote the idea to pin to the gui, I think is not in my opinion the production way to get it live. In a simple flow, you edit in a terminal , start nasm compiler in that terminal and then put an $ insight myprog to step in.
But you have the issue also with kate?
I will make a check, but I would stick to command line, or probably you will do that by rushing as the frequent use.

I decided to get an old 32 bit computer for this book instead, and got myself a Pentium 4 32 bit computer. This computer is probably 14 years old so its specs are really limited (mine has about 2G RAM and 80G hard drive storage, and USB drives don’t appear to work since I had to reset the CMOS on the motherboard, so I’m limited to using DVD drive as my main boot for installing OS). However, when I tried to get an ISO image burned on a dvd disk and to install Ubuntu 8.10 (of which release Jeff uses in his book) on this PC, an error occurred with a message “boot loader: /casper/vmlinuz” then stops going any further into installation. I searched online for answers, apparently some people are saying that the “vmlinuz” file inside casper directory in the ISO image file needs to have an “.efi” extension. I renamed the file as “vmlinuz.efi” using tool WinISO and tried again, still same error message.. then I went to check all the releases of Ubuntu for 32 bit desktop PC, and it appears all of the “vmlinuz” file inside “casper” folder do not have .efi extension; but all the 64 bit releases do. – Does that mean none of the 32 bit Ubuntu releases work?
Do you have any idea what might be going on there?

Hi,
As the current version works well, could I ask why did you revert to an older one?
Anyway, if you decided to move back, I would use a VM, that takes , generally, care of details related to old combinations.
Also my installs are VMs, with little or no data, and intended to be used and trashed, if the case: the deploy of the 4.5 gb ova file, requires 6 minutes, bye bye bad! And use a new one.

Just a note to express my thanks for this! I had been pulling my hair out with all my failed attempts to get Insight to work, and was beginning to despair of the usefulness of Jeff Duntemann’s book. Now that I’ve got Insight up and running I’m excited to continue learning assembly language. Molte grazie!

Could you let me know if the new setup came back from an updated version of repository, or if there were updates on ubuntu before trying to reproduce or both?

Yup, I used the latest version from github as instructed, can’t find any older version, the developer just patched the gdbtk.c recently… Last successful installed was 21st may 2016.

Hi, git is there to support the checkout of previous commits. So , if you clone the repo locally you can revert to a previous version, and we know that it was one working.
As soon as I can I will try to identify a commit that works. The goal is having insight working, not having the latest commit.

So could you make a fresh install from the 16.04 LTS , and install only the dependencies listed? So we could know if the issue is strictly related to what is needed or comes with some corollary package?

Yes, I did a fresh install on vbox, this is what I installed:
Reading package lists…
Building dependency tree…
Reading state information…
autoconf is already the newest version (2.69-9).
bison is already the newest version (2:3.0.4.dfsg-1).
flex is already the newest version (2.6.0-11).
libjpeg-dev is already the newest version (8c-2ubuntu8).
mesa-common-dev is already the newest version (11.2.0-1ubuntu2).
python-dev is already the newest version (2.7.11-1).
tcl-dev is already the newest version (8.6.0+9).
tk-dev is already the newest version (8.6.0+9).
zlib1g-dev is already the newest version (1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4).
autogen is already the newest version (1:5.18.7-3).
itcl3 is already the newest version (3.4.3-1).
itk3 is already the newest version (3.4.2-1).
iwidgets4 is already the newest version (4.0.1-6).

texinfo is already the newest version (6.1.0.dfsg.1-5).
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 191 not upgraded.

Still the same errors, so I gave up and use gdb in terminal instead.

Thank You very much for following up to the solution. So you contacted Patrick Monnerat? Could you you let us know if the bug emerged just in the Ubuntu build, and was not detected in the Fedora build (this repository is used for the native package on Fedora)?
It should be very useful to know. The reason I did not pointed to the code in itself , is that is used to supply insight for Fedora, so was thinking more to some specific issue in the ubuntu build.
Thanks a lot!

Hi, I got a kind contact by Patrick Monnerat, that suggested that g++ and liblzma-dev are needed for Mint. It seems that g++ is already there in Ubuntu and liblzma-dev was not needed. So who is using Mint could make a check about these 2 more dependencies and let us know.
I cannot support other flavors than Ubuntu, but when I get some useful hint, I am happy to make it known.
As Patrick pointed, now insight is actually built in C++ so g++ is needed as a fundamental part of the environment.
Thanks

Hi,
quite strange. Anyway, to check if there is some issue with x permission, could you check that the insight file is found in the path, with a find /usr -name insight ?
Hope to get some feedback.
PS. Sorry for the trivial question: did you issue the last command “sudo make install”?

Please, I need help. Some error has occurred while trying to change the file attribute to .sh. It reads on Konsole: “chmod: cannot access ‘insight.sh’: No such file or directory”. But I’m under the same directory as the file I’ve created via this tutorial (insight). I have no idea why it’s not working. I’m not as near proficient at Linux. I really need some aid in order to continue. I’m reading Assembly Language step-by-step, and it makes use of insight as a main debugger for the study. I won’t be able to carry on with this book if I don’t get it to work.

So I added –target=powerpc-elf in the configure command.

Finally the make process works well, this is just the make install who fails. This is not important as I can start insight in the current folder. But I would like to use an older version of insight as this one uses gdb 8.0 and I need a 7.8.2. Maybe with git I can have older sources?
