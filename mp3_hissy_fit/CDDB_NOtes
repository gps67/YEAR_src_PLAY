filename.cddb uses latin1 instead of utf8
It has no way of switching into utf-8, eg for asian script
grip uses utf8, but that causes double encoding in ID3

BUT protocol version 6 uses UTF8 ....

Of course the real problem lies with MusicBrainz,
and the need for a common set of tags
(Why does .cddb put the authors and title in the same line ?)

ID3 uses ...

X11 with a uk keyboard is using american button placements for dead-keys
eg AltGr # e becomes Ã¨ because KB-US has a \ there (maybe)
so use one of the desktop accessories 
ubuntu / gnome / Applications / accessories / character map
